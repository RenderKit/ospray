OSPRay parallel rendering on TACC's "Stallion" display wall
===========================================================

[![](gallery/ospray_stallion-thumb.jpg)](gallery/ospray_stallion.jpg)

This photo shows OSPRay running on the [Stallion 328 megapixel tiled
display](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/vislab/stallion) at the Texas
Advanced Computing Center (TACC) visualization lab. OSPRay is rendering
in an MPI parallel mode and interactively streaming to the tiled display
via its
[DisplayCluster](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-software/displaycluster)
interface. These features are scheduled to be released in OSPRay v0.9.

The model used is courtesy Florida International University and the
Texas Advanced Computing Center, and stems from a simulation of Ground
Water Flow performed by Florida International University.
