If you have a project that makes use of OSPRay and would like this to be
listed here, please let us know.


BALLView
--------

[Prof Andreas
Hildebrandt](http://bio.informatik.uni-mainz.de/members/andreas.hildebrandt),
head of the [Software Engineering and Bioinformatics
group](http://bio.informatik.uni-mainz.de/) at the University of Mainz
is currently creating an OSPRay rendering module for their
[BALLView](http://www.ballview.org/) package, a standalone molecular
modelling and visualization application for the "BALL" Biochemical
Algorithm Library.


GLuRay

pvOSPRay: A OSPRay Plugin to ParaView/VTKx
------------------------------------------

[![](related_projects/vtk-paraview/screenshot-paraview-fiu-thumb.jpg)](related_projects/vtk-paraview/screenshot-paraview-fiu.jpg)

The Remote Visualization Group at the [Texas Advanced Computing
Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) (TACC) is building and maintaining
OSPRay plugins for ParaView, VisIt, and VTK. The [screenshot supplied
here](pvospray.html) shows a working version of ParaView, rendering a
non-trivial model through OSPRay. All three OSPRay plugins are hosted on
TACC's github pages: [pvOSPRay](https://github.com/TACC/pvOSPRay) for
the ParaView module, [visitOSPRay](https://github.com/TACC/visitOSPRay)
for the VisIt module, and [vtkOSPRay](https://github.com/TACC/vtkOSPRay)
for the base VTK module.


StingRay
--------

SURVICE Engineering's ["StingRay"
toolkit](http://www.rtvtk.org/~cgribble/research/papers/gribble14high.pdf)
makes use of Embree for simulating radio frequency, and uses OSPRay for
visualizing the resuls.


Projects that are closely related to OSPRay
===========================================

-   The [Embree](http://embree.github.io) Ray Tracing Kernel Framework
-   The [IntelÂ® SPMD Program Compiler](http://ispc.github.io) (ISPC)
-   OSPRay's "sister project" is [OpenSWR](http://OpenSWR.github.io)
    (**o**pen **s**oft**w**are **r**asterizer), a new high-performance,
    highly-scalable, software OpenGL implementation that runs on host
    CPUs.
