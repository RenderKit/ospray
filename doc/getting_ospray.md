Download Precompiled OSPRay Binary Packages
===========================================

Prerequisites
-------------

Your CPU must support at least SSE4.1 or NEON to run OSPRay. The TGZ/ZIP
packages contain most needed 3rd party dependencies. Additionally you
need

- To run the example viewer: OpenGL
- To use the distributed, multi-node rendering feature: IntelÂ® [MPI
  Library](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mpi-library/))

We recommend the latest version of both TBB and Embree libraries.
