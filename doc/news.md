Dec 12, 2014: OSPRay "Alpha" Release Now Available
--------------------------------------------------

Following our announcement at Supercomputing 2014, an early "alpha"
version of OSPRay is now available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ospray/OSPRay). The main purpose of this
"alpha" release is to give interested parties an early indication of the
capabilities, features, and performance they can expect from the
eventual 1.0 version (which we anticipate releasing in 2015), as well as
to give early adopters "something" to experiment with that is
unencumbered by NDAs.

Being an "alpha"-level release a certain amount of bugs, as-yet-missing
features, or any other issues in the current version cannot be ruled
out; however, we are committed to eradicating all such issues as soon as
possible, and will constantly be posting bugfix-releases for fixed
issues. Should you find any such issues please report them immediately
via [OSPRay's GitHub Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/ospray/OSPRay/issues) (or send us a pull
request); for missing features please contact us via email at
<ospray@googlegroups.com>.
