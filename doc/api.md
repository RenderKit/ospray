OSPRay API
==========

To access the OSPRay API you first need to include the OSPRay header

    #include "ospray/ospray.h"

where the API is compatible with C99 and C++.


Initialization and Shutdown
---------------------------

To use the API, OSPRay must be initialized with a "device". A
device is the object which implements the API. Creating and initializing
a device can be done in either of two ways: command line arguments using
`ospInit` or manually instantiating a device and setting parameters on
it.

### Command Line Arguments

The first is to do so by giving OSPRay the command line from `main()` by
calling

    OSPError ospInit(int *argc, const char **argv);

OSPRay parses (and removes) its known command line parameters from your
application's `main` function. For an example see the [tutorial]. For
possible error codes see section [Error Handling and Status Messages].
It is important to note that the arguments passed to `ospInit()` are
processed in order they are listed. The following parameters (which are
prefixed by convention with "`--osp:`") are understood:

  -------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  Parameter                  Description
  -------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  `--osp:debug`              enables various extra checks and debug output, and
                             disables multi-threading

  `--osp:numthreads <n>`     use `n` threads instead of per default using all
                             detected hardware threads

  `--osp:loglevel <n>`       set logging level, default `0`; increasing `n` means
                             increasingly verbose log messages

  `--osp:verbose`            shortcut for `--osp:loglevel 1` and enable debug
                             output on console

  `--osp:vv`                 shortcut for `--osp:loglevel 2` and enable debug
                             output on console

  `--osp:module:<name>`      load a module during initialization; equivalent to
                             calling `ospLoadModule(name)`

  `--osp:logoutput <dst>`    convenience for setting where status messages go;
                             valid values for `dst` are `cerr` and `cout`

  `--osp:erroroutput <dst>`  convenience for setting where error messages go;
                             valid values for `dst` are `cerr` and `cout`

  `--osp:device:<name>`      use `name` as the type of device for OSPRay to
                             create; e.g., `--osp:device:default` gives you the
                             default local device; Note if the device to be used
                             is defined in a module, remember to pass
                             `--osp:module:<name>` first

  `--osp:setaffinity <n>`    if `1`, bind software threads to hardware threads;
                             `0` disables binding; default is `1` on KNL and `0`
                             otherwise
  -------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  : Command line parameters accepted by OSPRay's `ospInit`.

### Manual Device Instantiation

The second method of initialization is to explicitly create the device
and possibly set parameters. This method looks almost identical to how
other [objects] are created and used by OSPRay (described in later
sections). The first step is to create the device with

    OSPDevice ospNewDevice(const char *type);

where the `type` string maps to a specific device implementation. OSPRay
always provides the "`default`" device, which maps to a fast, local CPU
implementation. Other devices can also be added through additional
modules, such as distributed MPI device implementations.

Once a device is created, you can call

    void ospDeviceSet1i(OSPDevice, const char *id, int val);
    void ospDeviceSetString(OSPDevice, const char *id, const char *val);
    void ospDeviceSetVoidPtr(OSPDevice, const char *id, void *val);

to set parameters on the device. The following parameters can be set on
all devices:

  ------ ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------
  Type   Name         Description
  ------ ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------
  int    numThreads   number of threads which OSPRay should use

  int    logLevel     logging level

  string logOutput    convenience for setting where status messages go; valid
                      values are `cerr` and `cout`

  string errorOutput  convenience for setting where error messages go; valid
                      values  are `cerr` and `cout`

  int    debug        set debug mode; equivalent to logLevel=2 and numThreads=1

  int    setAffinity  bind software threads to hardware threads if set to 1;
                      0 disables binding omitting the parameter will let OSPRay
                      choose
  ------ ------------ ----------------------------------------------------------
  : Parameters shared by all devices.

Once parameters are set on the created device, the device must be
committed with

    void ospDeviceCommit(OSPDevice);

To use the newly committed device, you must call

    void ospSetCurrentDevice(OSPDevice);

This then sets the given device as the object which will respond to all
other OSPRay API calls.

Users can change parameters on the device after initialization (from
either method above), by calling

    OSPDevice ospGetCurrentDevice();

This function returns the handle to the device currently used to respond
to OSPRay API calls, where users can set/change parameters and recommit
the device. If changes are made to the device that is already set as the
current device, it does not need to be set as current again.

OSPRay allows applications to query runtime properties of a device in
order to do enhanced validation of what device was loaded at runtime.
The following function can be used to get these device-specific
properties (attiributes about the device, not paramter values)

    int64_t ospDeviceGetProperty(OSPDevice, OSPDeviceProperty);

It returns an integer value of the queried property and the following
properties can be provided as parameter:

    OSP_DEVICE_VERSION
    OSP_DEVICE_VERSION_MAJOR
    OSP_DEVICE_VERSION_MINOR
    OSP_DEVICE_VERSION_PATCH
    OSP_DEVICE_SO_VERSION

### Environment Variables

OSPRay's generic device parameters can be overridden via
environment variables for easy changes to OSPRay's behavior without
needing to change the application (variables are prefixed by convention
with "`OSPRAY_`"):

  --------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  Variable              Description
  --------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  OSPRAY_THREADS        equivalent to `--osp:numthreads`

  OSPRAY_LOG_LEVEL      equivalent to `--osp:loglevel`

  OSPRAY_LOG_OUTPUT     equivalent to `--osp:logoutput`

  OSPRAY_ERROR_OUTPUT   equivalent to `--osp:erroroutput`

  OSPRAY_DEBUG          equivalent to `--osp:debug`

  OSPRAY_SET_AFFINITY   equivalent to `--osp:setaffinity`

  OSPRAY_LOAD_MODULES   equivalent to `--osp:module:`, can be a comma separated
                        list of modules which will be loaded in order

  OSPRAY_DEFAULT_DEVICE equivalent to `--osp:device:`
  --------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  : Environment variables interpreted by OSPRay.

Note that these environment variables take precedence over values
specified through `ospInit` or manually set parameters.

### Error Handling and Status Messages

The following errors are currently used by OSPRay:

  Name                   Description
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  OSP_NO_ERROR           no error occurred
  OSP_UNKNOWN_ERROR      an unknown error occurred
  OSP_INVALID_ARGUMENT   an invalid argument was specified
  OSP_INVALID_OPERATION  the operation is not allowed for the specified object
  OSP_OUT_OF_MEMORY      there is not enough memory to execute the command
  OSP_UNSUPPORTED_CPU    the CPU is not supported (minimum ISA is SSE4.1)
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------------
  : Possible error codes, i.e., valid named constants of type `OSPError`.

These error codes are either directly return by some API functions, or
are recorded to be later queried by the application via

    OSPError ospDeviceGetLastErrorCode(OSPDevice);

A more descriptive error message can be queried by calling

    const char* ospDeviceGetLastErrorMsg(OSPDevice);

Alternatively, the application can also register a callback function of
type

    typedef void (*OSPErrorFunc)(OSPError, const char* errorDetails);

via

    void ospDeviceSetErrorFunc(OSPDevice, OSPErrorFunc);

to get notified when errors occur.

Applications may be interested in messages which OSPRay emits, whether
for debugging or logging events. Applications can call

    void ospDeviceSetStatusFunc(OSPDevice, OSPStatusFunc);

in order to register a callback function of type

    typedef void (*OSPStatusFunc)(const char* messageText);

which OSPRay will use to emit status messages. By default, OSPRay uses a
callback which does nothing, so any output desired by an application
will require that a callback is provided. Note that callbacks for C++
`std::cout` and `std::cerr` can be alternatively set through `ospInit()`
or the `OSPRAY_LOG_OUTPUT` environment variable.

Applications can clear either callback by passing `nullptr` instead of an
actual function pointer.

### Loading OSPRay Extensions at Runtime

OSPRay's functionality can be extended via plugins (which we call
"modules"), which are implemented in shared libraries. To load module
`name` from `libospray_module_<name>.so` (on Linux and Mac OS\ X) or
`ospray_module_<name>.dll` (on Windows) use

    OSPError ospLoadModule(const char *name);

Modules are searched in OS-dependent paths. `ospLoadModule` returns
`OSP_NO_ERROR` if the plugin could be successfully loaded.

### Shutting Down OSPRay

When the application is finished using OSPRay (typically on application
exit), the OSPRay API should be finalized with

    void ospShutdown();

This API call ensures that the current device is cleaned up
appropriately. Due to static object allocation having non-deterministic
ordering, it is recommended that applications call `ospShutdown()`
before the calling application process terminates.

Objects
-------

All entities of OSPRay (the renderer, volumes, geometries, lights,
cameras, ...) are a logical specialization of `OSPObject` and share
common mechanism to deal with parameters and lifetime.

An important aspect of object parameters is that parameters do not get
passed to objects immediately. Instead, parameters are not visible at
all to objects until they get explicitly committed to a given object via
a call to

    void ospCommit(OSPObject);

at which time all previously additions or changes to parameters are
visible at the same time. If a user wants to change the state of an
existing object (e.g., to change the origin of an already existing
camera) it is perfectly valid to do so, as long as the changed
parameters are recommitted.

The commit semantic allow for batching up multiple small changes, and
specifies exactly when changes to objects will occur. This can impact
performance and consistency for devices crossing a PCI bus or across a
network.

Note that OSPRay uses reference counting to manage the lifetime of all
objects, so one cannot explicitly "delete" any object. Instead, to
indicate that the application does not need and does not access the
given object anymore, call

    void ospRelease(OSPObject);

This decreases its reference count and if the count reaches `0` the
object will automatically get deleted. Passing `NULL` is not an error.

Sometimes applications may want to have more than one reference to an
object, where it is desirable for the application to increment the
reference count of an object. This is done with

    void ospRetain(OSPObject);

It is important to note that this is only necessary if the application
wants to call `ospRelease` on an object more than once: objects which
contain other objects as parameters internally increment/decrement ref
counts and should not be explicitly done by the application.

### Parameters

Parameters allow to configure the behavior of and to pass data to
objects.  However, objects do _not_ have an explicit interface for
reasons of high flexibility and a more stable compile-time API. Instead,
parameters are passed separately to objects in an arbitrary order, and
unknown parameters will simply be ignored (though a warning message will
be posted). The following function allows adding various types of
parameters with name `id` to a given object:

    void ospSetParam(OSPObject, const char *id, OSPDataType type, const void *mem);

The valid parameter names for all `OSPObject`s and what types are valid
are discussed in future sections.

Note that `mem` must always be a pointer _to_ the object,
otherwise accidental type casting can occur. This is especially true for
pointer types (`OSP_VOID_PTR` and `OSPObject` handles), as they will
implicitly cast to `void *`, but be incorrectly interpreted. To help
with some of these issues, there also exist variants of `ospSetParam`
for specific types, such as `ospSetInt` and `ospSetVec3f` in the
[OSPRay utility library](util.md) (found in `ospray_util.h`).

Users can also remove parameters that have been explicitly set from
`ospSetParam`. Any parameters which have been removed will go back to
their default value during the next commit unless a new parameter
was set after the parameter was removed. To remove a parameter, use

    void ospRemoveParam(OSPObject, const char *id);

### Data

OSPRay consumes data arrays from the application using a specific
object type, `OSPData`. There are several components to describing a
data array: element type, 1/2/3 dimensional striding, and whether the
array is shared with the application or copied into opaque,
OSPRay-owned memory.

Shared data arrays require that the application's array memory outlives
the lifetime of the created `OSPData`, as OSPRay is referring to
application memory. Where this is not preferable, applications use
opaque arrays to allow the `OSPData` to own the lifetime of the array
memory. However, opaque arrays dictate the cost of copying data into it,
which should be kept in mind.

Thus the most efficient way to specify a data array from the application
is to created a shared data array, which is done with

    OSPData ospNewSharedData(const void *sharedData,
                       OSPDataType,
      uint32_t numItems1,
      int64_t byteStride1 = 0,
      uint32_t numItems2 = 1,
      int64_t byteStride2 = 0,
      uint32_t numItems3 = 1,
      int64_t byteStride3 = 0);

The call returns an `OSPData` handle to the created array. The calling
program guarantees that the `sharedData` pointer will remain valid for
the duration that this data array is being used. The number of elements
`numItems` must be positive (there cannot be an empty data object).
The data is arranged in three dimensions, with specializations to two or
one dimension (if some `numItems` are 1). The distance between
consecutive elements (per dimension) is given in bytes with `byteStride`
and can also be negative. If `byteStride` is zero it will be determined
automatically (e.g., as `sizeof(type)`). Strides do not need to be
ordered, i.e., `byteStride2` can be smaller than `byteStride1`, which is
equivalent to a transpose. However, if the stride should be calculated,
then an ordering like `byteStride1 < byteStride2` is assumed to
disambiguate.

The enum type `OSPDataType` describes the different element types that
can be represented in OSPRay; valid constants are listed in the table
below.

  ---------------------- -----------------------------------------------
  : Valid named constants for `OSPDataType`.

An opaque `OSPData` with memory allocated by OSPRay is created with

    OSPData ospNewData(OSPDataType,
      uint32_t numItems1,
      uint32_t numItems2 = 1,
      uint32_t numItems3 = 1);

To allow for (partial) copies or updates of data arrays use

    void ospCopyData(const OSPData source,
      OSPData destination,
      uint32_t destinationIndex1 = 0,
      uint32_t destinationIndex2 = 0,
      uint32_t destinationIndex3 = 0);

which will copy the whole^[The number of items to be copied is defined
by the size of the source array] content of the `source` array into
`destination` at the given location `destinationIndex`. The
`OSPDataType`s of the data objects must match. The region to be copied
must be valid inside the destination, i.e., in all dimensions,
`destinationIndex + sourceSize <= destinationSize`. The affected region
`[destinationIndex, destinationIndex + sourceSize)` is marked as dirty,
which may be used by OSPRay to only process or update that sub-region
(e.g., updating an acceleration structure). If the destination array is
shared with OSPData by the application (created with
`ospNewSharedData`), then

  - the source array must be shared as well (thus `ospCopyData` cannot
    be used to read opaque data)
  - if source and destination memory overlaps (aliasing), then behaviour
    is undefined
  - except if source and destination regions are identical (including
    matching strides), which can be used by application to mark that
    region as dirty (instead of the whole `OSPData`)

To add a data array as parameter named `id` to another object call also
use

    void ospSetObject(OSPObject, const char *id, OSPData);


Volumes
-------

Volumes are volumetric data sets with discretely sampled values in 3D
space, typically a 3D scalar field. To create a new volume object of
given type `type` use

    OSPVolume ospNewVolume(const char *type);

The call returns `NULL` if that type of volume is not known by OSPRay,
or else a valid `OSPVolume` handle.

### Structured Volume

Structured volumes only need to store the values of the samples, because
their addresses in memory can be easily computed from a 3D position. A
common type of structured volumes are regular grids.

Structured volumes are created by passing the `structured_volume`
type string to `ospNewVolume`. Structured volumes are represented
through an `OSPData` array (which may or may not be shared with the
application), where the voxel data is laid out in memory in
xyz-order^[For consecutive memory addresses the x-index of the
corresponding voxel changes the quickest.]

The parameters understood by structured volumes are summarized in the
table below.

  ------ ----------- -----------  -----------------------------------
  Type   Name            Default  Description
  ------ ----------- -----------  -----------------------------------
  vec3i  dimensions               number of voxels in each
                                  dimension $(x, y, z)$

  int    voxelType                `OSPDataType` of each voxel,
                                  currently supported are:

                                  `OSP_UCHAR`

                                  `OSP_SHORT`

                                  `OSP_USHORT`

                                  `OSP_FLOAT`

                                  `OSP_DOUBLE`

  vec3f  gridOrigin  $(0, 0, 0)$  origin of the grid in world-space

  vec3f  gridSpacing $(1, 1, 1)$  size of the grid cells in
                                  world-space

  : Additional configuration parameters for structured volumes.

### Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) Volume

AMR volumes are specified as a list of blocks, which exist at levels of
refinement in potentially overlapping regions.  Blocks exist in a tree
structure, with coarser refinement level blocks containing finer blocks.  The
cell width is equal for all blocks at the same refinement level, though blocks
at a coarser level have a larger cell width than finer levels.

There can be any number of refinement levels and any number of blocks at any
level of refinement. An AMR volume type is created by passing the type string
`"amr_volume"` to `ospNewVolume`.

Blocks are defined by four parameters: their bounds, the refinement level in
which they reside, the cell widths for each refinement level, and the scalar
data contained within each block.

Note that cell widths are defined _per refinement level_, not per block.

  -------------- --------------- -----------------  -----------------------------------
  Type           Name                      Default  Description
  -------------- --------------- -----------------  -----------------------------------

                                                    Supported methods are:

                                                    `OSP_AMR_CURRENT`

                                                    `OSP_AMR_FINEST`

                                                    `OSP_AMR_OCTANT`

  int[]          block.level                  NULL  array of each block's refinement
                                                    level

  float[]        block.cellWidth              NULL  array of each block's cell width

  OSPData[]      block.data                   NULL  [data] array of OSPData containing
                                                    the actual scalar voxel data

  vec3f          gridOrigin            $(0, 0, 0)$  origin of the grid in world-space

  vec3f          gridSpacing           $(1, 1, 1)$  size of the grid cells in
                                                    world-space
  -------------- --------------- -----------------  -----------------------------------
  : Additional configuration parameters for AMR volumes.

Lastly, note that the `gridOrigin` and `gridSpacing` parameters act just like
the structured volume equivalent, but they only modify the root (coarsest level)
of refinement.

In particular, OSPRay's AMR implementation was designed to cover
Berger-Colella [1] and Chombo [2] AMR data.  The `method` parameter above
determines the interpolation method used when sampling the volume.

* `OSP_AMR_CURRENT` finds the finest refinement level at that cell and
  interpolates through this "current" level
* `OSP_AMR_FINEST` will interpolate at the closest existing cell in the
  volume-wide finest refinement level regardless of the sample cell's level
* `OSP_AMR_OCTANT` interpolates through all available refinement levels at that
  cell. This method avoids discontinuities at refinement level boundaries at
  the cost of performance

Details and more information can be found in the publication for the
implementation [3].

### Unstructured Volumes

Unstructured volumes can have its topology and geometry freely defined.
Geometry can be composed of tetrahedral, hexahedral, wedge or pyramid
cell types. Used data format is compatible with VTK and consists from
multiple arrays: vertex positions and values, vertex indices, cell start
indices, cell types, and cell values. An unstructured volume type is
created by passing the type string "`unstructured_volume`" to
`ospNewVolume`.

Sampled cell values can be specified either per-vertex (`vertex.value`)
or per-cell (`cell.value`). If both arrays are set, `cell.value` takes
precedence.

Similar to a mesh, each cell is formed by a group of indices into the
vertices. For each vertex, the corresponding (by array index) data value
will be used for sampling when rendering, if specified. The index order
for a tetrahedron is the same as `VTK_TETRA`: bottom triangle
counterclockwise, then the top vertex.

For hexahedral cells, each hexahedron is formed by a group of eight
indices into the vertices and data values. Vertex ordering is the same as
`VTK_HEXAHEDRON`: four bottom vertices counterclockwise, then top four
counterclockwise.

For wedge cells, each wedge is formed by a group of six indices into the
vertices and data values. Vertex ordering is the same as `VTK_WEDGE`:
three bottom vertices counterclockwise, then top three counterclockwise.

For pyramid cells, each cell is formed by a group of five indices into
the vertices and data values. Vertex ordering is the same as
`VTK_PYRAMID`: four bottom vertices counterclockwise, then the top
vertex.

To maintain VTK data compatibility an index array may be specified via
`indexPrefixed` array that allow vertex indices to be interleaved with
cell sizes in the following format: $n, id_1, ..., id_n, m, id_1, ...,
id_m$.

  : Additional configuration parameters for unstructured volumes.

### Transfer Function

Transfer functions map the scalar values of volumes to color and opacity
and thus they can be used to visually emphasize certain features of the
volume. To create a new transfer function of given type `type` use

    OSPTransferFunction ospNewTransferFunction(const char *type);

The call returns `NULL` if that type of transfer functions is not known
by OSPRay, or else an `OSPTransferFunction` handle to the created
transfer function. That handle can be assigned to a volumetric model
(described below) as parameter "`transferFunction`" using
`ospSetObject`.

One type of transfer function that is supported by OSPRay is the linear
transfer function, which interpolates between given equidistant colors
and opacities. It is create by passing the string "`piecewise_linear`"
to `ospNewTransferFunction` and it is controlled by these parameters:

  Type         Name        Description
  ------------ ----------- ----------------------------------------------
  vec3f[]      color       [data] array of RGB colors
  float[]      opacity     [data] array of opacities
  vec2f        valueRange  domain (scalar range) this function maps from
  ------------ ----------- ----------------------------------------------
  : Parameters accepted by the linear transfer function.


### VolumetricModels

Volumes in OSPRay are given volume rendering appearance information
through VolumetricModels. This decouples the physical representation of
the volume (and possible acceleration structures it contains) to
rendering-specific parameters (where more than one set may exist
concurrently). To create a volume instance, call

    OSPVolumetricModel ospNewVolumetricModel(OSPVolume volume);

  -------------------- ----------------------- ---------- --------------------------------------
  Type                 Name                    Default    Description
  -------------------- ----------------------- ---------- --------------------------------------
  OSPTransferFunction  transferFunction                   [transfer function] to use

  float                samplingRate                 0.125 sampling rate of the volume (this
                                                          is the minimum step size for
                                                          adaptive sampling)

                                                          or thicker ([path tracer] only)

                                                          Isotropic scattering. ([path tracer] only)
  -------------------- ------------------------ --------- ---------------------------------------
  : Parameters understood by VolumetricModel.


Geometries
----------

Geometries in OSPRay are objects that describe intersectable surfaces.
To create a new geometry object of given type `type` use

    OSPGeometry ospNewGeometry(const char *type);

The call returns `NULL` if that type of geometry is not known by OSPRay,
or else an `OSPGeometry` handle.

### Mesh

A mesh consiting of either triangles or quads is created by calling
`ospNewGeometry` with type string "`mesh`". Once created, a mesh
recognizes the following parameters:

  Type                 Name             Description
  -------------------- ---------------- -------------------------------------------------
  vec3f[]              vertex.position  [data] array of vertex positions
  vec3f[]              vertex.normal    [data] array of vertex normals
  vec4f[] / vec3f[]    vertex.color     [data] array of vertex colors (RGBA/RGB)
  vec2f[]              vertex.texcoord  [data] array of vertex texture coordinates
  vec3ui[] / vec4ui[]  index            [data] array of (either triangle or quad) indices (into the vertex array(s))
  -------------------- ---------------- -------------------------------------------------
  : Parameters defining a mesh geometry.

The data type of index arrays differentiates between the underlying
geometry, triangles are used for a index with `vec3ui` type and quads
for `vec4ui` type. Quads are internally handled as a pair of two
triangles, thus mixing triangles and quads is supported by encoding some
triangle as a quad with the last two vertex indices being identical
(`w=z`).

The `vertex.position` and `index` arrays are mandatory to create a valid
mesh.

### Subdivision

A mesh consisting of subdivision surfaces, created by specifying a
geometry of type "`subdivision`". Once created, a subdivision recognizes
the following parameters:

  --------------- -------------------- ------- -------------------------------------------------
  Type            Name                 Default Description
  --------------- -------------------- ------- -------------------------------------------------
  vec3f[]         vertex.position         NULL [data] array of vertex positions

  vec4f[]         vertex.color            NULL [data] array of vertex colors (RGBA)

  vec2f[]         vertex.texcoord         NULL [data] array of vertex texture coordinates

  float           level                      5 global level of tessellation, default is 5

  uint[]          index                   NULL [data] array of indices (into the vertex array(s))

  float[]         index.level             NULL [data] array of per-edge levels of tessellation,
                                               overrides global level

  uint[]          face                    NULL [data] array holding the number of indices/edges
                                               (3 to 15) per face

  vec2i[]         edgeCrease.index        NULL [data] array of edge crease indices

  float[]         edgeCrease.weight       NULL [data] array of edge crease weights

  uint[]          vertexCrease.index      NULL [data] array of vertex crease indices

  float[]         vertexCrease.weight     NULL [data] array of vertex crease weights
  --------------- -------------------- ------- -------------------------------------------------
  : Parameters defining a Subdivision geometry.

The `vertex` and `index` arrays are mandatory to create a valid
subdivision surface. If no `face` array is present then a pure quad
mesh is assumed (the number of indices must be a multiple of 4).
Optionally supported are edge and vertex creases.

### Spheres

A geometry consisting of individual spheres, each of which can have an
own radius, is created by calling `ospNewGeometry` with type string
"`spheres`". The spheres will not be tessellated but rendered
procedurally and are thus perfectly round. To allow a variety of sphere
representations in the application this geometry allows a flexible way
of specifying the data of center position and radius within a [data]
array:

  -------- ---------------- --------  ---------------------------------------
  Type     Name              Default  Description
  -------- ---------------- --------  ---------------------------------------
  vec3f[]  sphere.position            [data] array of center positions

  float[]  sphere.radius        NULL  optional [data] array of the per-sphere
                                      radius

  vec2f[]  sphere.texcoord      NULL  optional [data] array of texture
                                      coordinates (constant per sphere)

  float    radius               0.01  default radius for all spheres
                                      (if `sphere.radius` is not set)
  -------- ---------------- --------  ---------------------------------------
  : Parameters defining a spheres geometry.

### Curves

A geometry consisting of multiple curves is created by calling
`ospNewGeometry` with type string "`curves`".  The parameters defining
this geometry are listed in the table below.

  ------------------ ---------------------- -------------------------------------------
  Type               Name                   Description
  ------------------ ---------------------- -------------------------------------------
  vec4f[]            vertex.position_radius [data] array of vertex position and
                                            per-vertex radius

  vec3f[]            vertex.position        [data] array of vertex position

  float              radius                 global radius of all curves (if
                                            per-vertex radius is not used), default 0.01

  vec2f[]            vertex.texcoord        [data] array of per-vertex texture coordinates

  vec4f[]            vertex.color           [data] array of corresponding vertex
                                            colors (RGBA)

  vec3f[]            vertex.normal          [data] array of curve normals (only for
                                            "ribbon" curves)

  vec3f[]            vertex.tangent         [data] array of curve tangents (only for
                                            "hermite" curves)

  uint32[]           index                  [data] array of indices to the first vertex
                                            or tangent of a curve segment

  int                type                   `OSPCurveType` for rendering the curve.
                                            Supported types are:

                                            `OSP_FLAT`

                                            `OSP_ROUND`

                                            `OSP_RIBBON`

  int                basis                  `OSPCurveBasis` for defining the curve.
                                             Supported bases are:

                                            `OSP_LINEAR`

                                            `OSP_BEZIER`

                                            `OSP_BSPLINE`

                                            `OSP_HERMITE`

                                            `OSP_CATMULL_ROM`
  ------------------ ---------------------- -------------------------------------------
  : Parameters defining a curves geometry.

Depending upon the specified data type of vertex positions, the curves
will be implemented Embree curves or assembled from rounded and
linearly-connected segments.

Positions in `vertex.position_radius` format supports per-vertex varying
radii with data type `vec4f[]` and instantiate Embree curves internally
for the relevant type/basis mapping (See Embree documentation for
discussion of curve types and data formatting).

If a constant `radius` is used and positions are specified in a
`vec3f[]` type of `vertex.position` format, then type/basis defaults to
`OSP_ROUND` and `OSP_LINEAR` (this is the fastest and most memory
efficient mode). Implementation is with round linear segements where
each segment corresponds to a link between two vertices.


### Boxes

OSPRay can directly render axis-aligned bounding boxes without the need
to convert them to quads or triangles. To do so create a boxes
geometry by calling `ospNewGeometry` with type string "`boxes`".

  Type       Name       Description
  ---------- ---------- ------------------------------------------------------
  box3f[]    box        [data] array of boxes
  ---------- ---------- ------------------------------------------------------
  : Parameters defining a boxes geometry.

### Isosurfaces

OSPRay can directly render multiple isosurfaces of a volume without
first tessellating them. To do so create an isosurfaces geometry by
calling `ospNewGeometry` with type string "`isosurfaces`". Each
isosurface will be colored according to the provided volume's [transfer
function].

  Type       Name       Description
  ---------- ---------- ------------------------------------------------------
  float[]    isovalue   [data] array of isovalues
  OSPVolume  volume     handle of the [volume] to be isosurfaced
  ---------- ---------- ------------------------------------------------------
  : Parameters defining an isosurfaces geometry.

### GeometricModels

Geometries are matched with surface appearance information through
GeometricModels. These take a geometry, which defines the surface
representation, and applies either full-object or per-primitive color
and material information. To create a geometric model, call

    OSPGeometricModel ospNewGeometricModel(OSPGeometry geometry);

Color and material are fetched with the primitive ID of the hit (clamped to the
valid range, thus a single color or material is fine), or mapped first via the
`index` array (if present). All paramters are optional, however, some renderers
(notably the [path tracer]) require a material to be set.

  -------------- --------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  Type           Name                  Description
  -------------- --------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  OSPMaterial[]  material              [data] array of (per-primitive) materials

  vec4f[]        color                 optional [data] array of (per-primitive) colors

  uint8[]        index                 optional [data] array of per-primitive indices into
                                       `color` and `material`

  int/uint32     rendererMaterialIndex optional [data] index into the `material` parameter
                                       on the `renderer` (if it exists)

  uint32[]       rendererMaterialIndex optional [data] array of per-primitive indices into
                                       the `material` parameter on the `renderer` (if
                                       it exists)
  -------------- --------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  : Parameters understood by GeometricModel.


Lights
------

To create a new light source of given type `type` use

    OSPLight ospNewLight(const char *type);

The call returns `NULL` if that type of light is not known by the
renderer, or else an `OSPLight` handle to the created light source.
All light sources[^1] accept the following parameters:

  Type      Name        Default  Description
  --------- ---------- --------  ---------------------------------------
  vec3f     color         white  color of the light
  float     intensity         1  intensity of the light (a factor)
  bool      visible        true  whether the light can be directly seen
  --------- ---------- --------  ---------------------------------------
  : Parameters accepted by all lights.

The following light types are supported by most OSPRay renderers.

[^1]: The [HDRI light] is an exception, it knows about `intensity`, but
not about `color`.

### Directional Light / Distant Light

The distant light (or traditionally the directional light) is thought to
be far away (outside of the scene), thus its light arrives (almost)
as parallel rays. It is created by passing the type string "`distant`"
to `ospNewLight`. In addition to the [general parameters](#lights)
understood by all lights the distant light supports the following special
parameters:

  Type      Name             Description
  --------- ---------------- ---------------------------------------------
  vec3f     direction        main emission direction of the distant light
  float     angularDiameter  apparent size (angle in degree) of the light
  --------- ---------------- ---------------------------------------------
  : Special parameters accepted by the distant light.

Setting the angular diameter to a value greater than zero will result in
soft shadows when the renderer uses stochastic sampling (like the [path
tracer]). For instance, the apparent size of the sun is about 0.53°.

### Point Light / Sphere Light

The sphere light (or the special case point light) is a light emitting
uniformly in all directions from the surface towards the outside.
It does not emit any light towards the inside of the sphere.
It is created by passing the type string "`sphere`" to `ospNewLight`.
In addition to the [general parameters](#lights) understood by all lights
the sphere light supports the following special parameters:

  Type      Name      Description
  --------- --------- -----------------------------------------------
  vec3f     position  the center of the sphere light, in world-space
  float     radius    the size of the sphere light
  --------- --------- -----------------------------------------------
  : Special parameters accepted by the sphere light.

Setting the radius to a value greater than zero will result in soft
shadows when the renderer uses stochastic sampling (like the [path
tracer]).

### Spotlight

The spotlight is a light emitting into a cone of directions. It is
created by passing the type string "`spot`" to `ospNewLight`. In
addition to the [general parameters](#lights) understood by all lights
the spotlight supports the special parameters listed in the table.

  ------ ------------- ----------- ----------------------------------------------
  Type   Name          Default     Description
  ------ ------------- ----------- ----------------------------------------------
  vec3f  position      $(0, 0, 0)$ the center of the spotlight, in world-space

  vec3f  direction     $(0, 0, 1)$ main emission direction of the spot

  float  openingAngle          180 full opening angle (in degree) of the spot;
                                   outside of this cone is no illumination

  float  penumbraAngle           5 size (angle in degree) of the "penumbra", the
                                   region between the rim (of the illumination
                                   cone) and full intensity of the spot; should
                                   be smaller than half of `openingAngle`

  float  radius                  0 the size of the spotlight, the radius of a
                                   disk with normal `direction`
  ------ ------------- ----------- ----------------------------------------------
  : Special parameters accepted by the spotlight.

![Angles used by the spotlight.][imgSpotLight]

Setting the radius to a value greater than zero will result in soft
shadows when the renderer uses stochastic sampling (like the [path
tracer]).

### Quad Light

The quad^[actually a parallelogram] light is a planar, procedural area light source emitting
uniformly on one side into the half-space. It is created by passing the
type string "`quad`" to `ospNewLight`. In addition to the [general
parameters](#lights) understood by all lights the quad light supports
the following special parameters:

  Type   Name      Description
  ------ --------- -----------------------------------------------------
  vec3f  position  world-space position of one vertex of the quad light
  vec3f  edge1     vector to one adjacent vertex
  vec3f  edge2     vector to the other adjacent vertex
  ------ --------- -----------------------------------------------------
  : Special parameters accepted by the quad light.

![Defining a quad light which emits toward the reader.][imgQuadLight]

The emission side is determined by the cross product of `edge1`×`edge2`.
Note that only renderers that use stochastic sampling (like the path
tracer) will compute soft shadows from the quad light. Other renderers
will just sample the center of the quad light, which results in hard
shadows.

### HDRI Light

The HDRI light is a textured light source surrounding the scene and
illuminating it from infinity. It is created by passing the type string
"`hdri`" to `ospNewLight`. In addition to the [parameter
`intensity`](#lights) the HDRI light supports the following special
parameters:

  ------------ --------- --------------------------------------------------
  Type         Name      Description
  ------------ --------- --------------------------------------------------
  vec3f        up        up direction of the light in world-space

  vec3f        direction direction to which the center of the texture will
                         be mapped to (analog to [panoramic camera])

  OSPTexture   map       environment map in latitude / longitude format
  ------------ --------- --------------------------------------------------
  : Special parameters accepted by the HDRI light.

![Orientation and Mapping of an HDRI Light.][imgHDRILight]

Note that the currently only the [path tracer] supports the HDRI light.

### Ambient Light

The ambient light surrounds the scene and illuminates it from infinity
with constant radiance (determined by combining the [parameters `color`
and `intensity`](#lights)). It is created by passing the type string
"`ambient`" to `ospNewLight`.

Note that the [SciVis renderer] uses ambient lights to control the color
and intensity of the computed ambient occlusion (AO).

### Emissive Objects

The [path tracer] will consider illumination by [geometries] which have
a light emitting material assigned (for example the [Luminous]
material).


Scene Hierarchy
---------------

### Groups

Groups in OSPRay represent collections of GeometricModels and
VolumetricModels which share a common local-space coordinate system. To
create a group call

    OSPGroup ospNewGroup();

Groups take arrays of geometric models and volumetric models, but they
are optional. In other words, there is no need to create empty arrays if
there are no geometries or volumes in the group.

  ------------------ --------------- ----------  --------------------------------------
  Type               Name               Default  Description
  ------------------ --------------- ----------  --------------------------------------
  OSPData            geometry              NULL  [data] array of [GeometricModels]

  OSPData            volume                NULL  [data] array of [VolumetricModels]

  bool               dynamicScene         false  use RTC_SCENE_DYNAMIC flag (faster
                                                 BVH build, slower ray traversal),
                                                 otherwise uses RTC_SCENE_STATIC flag
                                                 (faster ray traversal, slightly
                                                 slower BVH build)

  bool               compactMode          false  tell Embree to use a more compact BVH
                                                 in memory by trading ray traversal
                                                 performance

  bool               robustMode           false  tell Embree to enable more robust ray
                                                 intersection code paths (slightly
                                                 slower)
  ------------------ --------------- ---------- ---------------------------------------
  : Parameters understood by groups.

Note that groups only need to re re-committed if a geometry or volume
changes (surface/scalar field representation). Appearance information
on `OSPGeometricModel` and `OSPVolumetricModel` can be changed freely,
as internal acceleration structures do not need to be reconstructed.

### Instances

Instances in OSPRay represent a single group's placement into the world
via a transform. To create and instance call

    OSPInstance ospNewInstance(OSPGroup);

  ------------------ --------------- ---------- --------------------------------------
  Type               Name               Default Description
  ------------------ --------------- ---------- --------------------------------------
  affine3f           xfm             (identity) world-space transform for all attached
                                                geometries and volumes
  ------------------ --------------- ---------- ---------------------------------------
  : Parameters understood by instances.


### World

Worlds are a container of scene data represented by [instances]. To
create an (empty) world call

    OSPWorld ospNewWorld();

Objects are placed in the world through an array of instances. Similar to
[group], the array of instances is optional: there is no need to create
empty arrays if there are no instances (though there will be nothing to
render).

Applications can query the world (axis-aligned) bounding box after the
world has been committed. To get this information, call

    OSPBounds ospGetBounds(OSPObject);

This call can also take `OSPGroup` and `OSPInstance` as well: all other
object types will return an empty bounding box.

Finally, Worlds can be configured with parameters for making various
feature/performance trade-offs (similar to groups).

  OSPLight[]    light                NULL  [data] array with handles of the
                                           [lights]

                                           otherwise uses RTC_SCENE_STATIC flag
                                           (faster ray traversal, slightly
                                           slower BVH build)

  bool          compactMode         false  tell Embree to use a more compact BVH
                                           in memory by trading ray traversal
                                           performance

  bool          robustMode          false  tell Embree to enable more robust ray
                                           intersection code paths (slightly
                                           slower)
  ------------- ---------------- --------  -------------------------------------
  : Parameters understood by worlds.


Renderers
---------

A renderer is the central object for rendering in OSPRay. Different
renderers implement different features and support different materials.
To create a new renderer of given type `type` use

    OSPRenderer ospNewRenderer(const char *type);

The call returns `NULL` if that type of renderer is not known, or else
an `OSPRenderer` handle to the created renderer. General parameters of
all renderers are

  -------------- ------------------ -----------  -----------------------------------------
  Type          Name                    Default  Description
  -------------- ------------------ -----------  -----------------------------------------
  int            spp                          1  samples per pixel

  int            maxDepth                    20  maximum ray recursion depth

  float          minContribution          0.001  sample contributions below this value
                                                 will be neglected to speedup rendering

  float          varianceThreshold            0  threshold for adaptive accumulation

  float /        bgColor                 black,  background color and alpha
  vec3f / vec4f                     transparent  (RGBA)

  OSPTexture     maxDepthTexture           NULL  screen-sized float [texture]
                                                 with maximum far distance per pixel
                                                 (use texture type `texture2d`)

  OSPMaterial[]  material                  NULL  [data] array of (per-primitive) materials
                                                 which can be indexed by a
                                                 [geometricmodel] if it has the
                                                 `rendererMaterialIndex` parameter
  -------------- ------------------ -----------  -----------------------------------------
  : Parameters understood by all renderers.

OSPRay's renderers support a feature called adaptive accumulation, which
accelerates progressive [rendering] by stopping the rendering and
refinement of image regions that have an estimated variance below the
`varianceThreshold`. This feature requires a [framebuffer] with an
`OSP_FB_VARIANCE` channel.

Per default the background of the rendered image will be transparent
black, i.e., the alpha channel holds the opacity of the rendered objects.
This eases transparency-aware blending of the image with an
arbitrary background image by the application. The parameter `bgColor`
can be used to already blend with a constant background color (and
alpha) during rendering.

OSPRay renderers support depth composition with images of other
renderers, for example to incorporate help geometries of a 3D UI that
were rendered with OpenGL. The screen-sized [texture] `maxDepthTexture`
must have format `OSP_TEXTURE_R32F` and flag
`OSP_TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST`. The fetched values are used to limit the
distance of primary rays, thus objects of other renderers can hide
objects rendered by OSPRay.

### SciVis Renderer

The SciVis renderer is a fast ray tracer for scientific visualization
which supports volume rendering and ambient occlusion (AO). It is
created by passing the  type string "`scivis`" to `ospNewRenderer`. In
addition to the [general parameters](#renderer) understood by all
renderers, the SciVis renderer supports the following parameters:

  ------------- ---------------------- ------------  ----------------------------
  Type          Name                        Default  Description
  ------------- ---------------------- ------------  ----------------------------
  int           aoSamples                         0  number of rays per sample to
                                                     compute ambient occlusion

  float         aoRadius                     10^20^  maximum distance to consider
                                                     for ambient occlusion

  float         aoIntensity                       1  ambient occlusion strength
  ------------- ---------------------- ------------  ----------------------------
  : Special parameters understood by the SciVis renderer.


### Path Tracer

The path tracer supports soft shadows, indirect illumination and
realistic materials. This renderer is created by passing the type string
"`pathtracer`" to `ospNewRenderer`. In addition to the [general
parameters](#renderer) understood by all renderers the path tracer
supports the following special parameters:

  ---------- ---------------- --------  -------------------------------------
  Type       Name              Default  Description
  ---------- ---------------- --------  -------------------------------------
  bool       geometryLights       true  whether to render light emitted from
                                        geometries

  int        rouletteDepth           5  ray recursion depth at which to
                                        start Russian roulette termination

  float      maxContribution         ∞  samples are clamped to this value
                                        before they are accumulated into
                                        the framebuffer

  OSPTexture backplate            NULL  [texture] image used as background,
                                        replacing visible lights in infinity
                                        (e.g., the [HDRI light])

  vec4f      shadowCatcherPlane      0  optional invisible plane that captures
                                        shadows for compositing
  ---------- ---------------- --------  -------------------------------------
  : Special parameters understood by the path tracer.

The path tracer requires that [materials] are assigned to [geometries],
otherwise surfaces are treated as completely black.

The path tracer supports [volumes](#volumes) with multiple scattering.
The scattering albedo can be specified using the [transfer function].
Extinction is assumed to be spectrally constant.

### Materials

Materials describe how light interacts with surfaces, they give objects
their distinctive look. To let the given renderer create a new material
of given type `type` call

    OSPMaterial ospNewMaterial(const char *renderer_type, const char *material_type);

The call returns `NULL` if the material type is not known by the
renderer type, or else an `OSPMaterial` handle to the created material. The
handle can then be used to assign the material to a given geometry with

    void ospSetObject(OSPGeometricModel, "material", OSPMaterial);

#### OBJ Material

The OBJ material is the workhorse material supported by both the [SciVis
renderer] and the [path tracer]. It offers widely used common properties
like diffuse and specular reflection and is based on the [MTL material
format](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/mtl/) of Lightwave's OBJ scene
files. To create an OBJ material pass the type string "`OBJMaterial`" to
`ospNewMaterial`. Its main parameters are

  Type          Name         Default  Description
  ------------- --------- ----------  -----------------------------------------
  vec3f         Kd         white 0.8  diffuse color
  vec3f         Ks             black  specular color
  float         Ns                10  shininess (Phong exponent), usually in [2–10^4^]
  float         d             opaque  opacity
  vec3f         Tf             black  transparency filter color
  OSPTexture    map_Bump        NULL  normal map
  ------------- --------- ----------  -----------------------------------------
  : Main parameters of the OBJ material.

In particular when using the path tracer it is important to adhere to
the principle of energy conservation, i.e., that the amount of light
reflected by a surface is not larger than the light arriving. Therefore
the path tracer issues a warning and renormalizes the color parameters
if the sum of `Kd`, `Ks`, and `Tf` is larger than one in any color
channel. Similarly important to mention is that almost all materials of
the real world reflect at most only about 80% of the incoming light. So
even for a white sheet of paper or white wall paint do better not set
`Kd` larger than 0.8; otherwise rendering times are unnecessary long and
the contrast in the final images is low (for example, the corners of a
white room would hardly be discernible, as can be seen in the figure
below).

![Comparison of diffuse rooms with 100% reflecting white paint (left)
and realistic 80% reflecting white paint (right), which leads to
higher overall contrast. Note that exposure has been adjusted to achieve
similar brightness levels.][imgDiffuseRooms]

If present, the color component of [geometries] is also used for the
diffuse color `Kd` and the alpha component is also used for the opacity
`d`.

Note that currently only the path tracer implements colored transparency
with `Tf`.

Normal mapping can simulate small geometric features via the texture
`map_Bump`. The normals $n$ in the normal map are with respect to the local
tangential shading coordinate system and are encoded as $½(n+1)$, thus a
texel $(0.5, 0.5, 1)$^[respectively $(127, 127, 255)$ for 8\ bit
textures] represents the unperturbed shading normal $(0, 0, 1)$. Because
of this encoding an sRGB gamma [texture] format is ignored and normals
are always fetched as linear from a normal map. Note that the
orientation of normal maps is important for a visually consistent look:
by convention OSPRay uses a coordinate system with the origin in the
lower left corner; thus a convexity will look green toward the top of
the texture image (see also the example image of a normal map). If this
is not the case flip the normal map vertically or invert its green
channel.

![Normal map representing an exalted square pyramidal
frustum.][imgNormalMap]

All parameters (except `Tf`) can be textured by passing a [texture]
handle, prefixed with "`map_`". The fetched texels are multiplied by the
respective parameter value. Texturing requires [geometries] with texture
coordinates, e.g., a [triangle mesh] with `vertex.texcoord` provided.
The color textures `map_Kd` and `map_Ks` are typically in one of the
sRGB gamma encoded formats, whereas textures `map_Ns` and `map_d` are
usually in a linear format (and only the first component is used).
Additionally, all textures support [texture transformations].

![Rendering of a OBJ material with wood textures.][imgMaterialOBJ]

#### Principled

The Principled material is the most complex material offered by the
[path tracer], which is capable of producing a wide variety of materials
(e.g., plastic, metal, wood, glass) by combining multiple different layers
and lobes. It uses the GGX microfacet distribution with approximate multiple
scattering for dielectrics and metals, uses the Oren-Nayar model for diffuse
reflection, and is energy conserving. To create a Principled material, pass
the type string "`Principled`" to `ospNewMaterial`. Its parameters are
listed in the table below.

  float  opacity                    1  cut-out opacity/transparency, 1 is fully opaque
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  : Parameters of the Principled material.

All parameters can be textured by passing a [texture] handle, prefixed
with "`map_`" (e.g., "`map_baseColor`"). [texture transformations] are
supported as well.

anisotropic rotation and a dust layer (sheen) on top.][imgMaterialPrincipled]

#### CarPaint

The CarPaint material is a specialized version of the Principled material for
rendering different types of car paints. To create a CarPaint material, pass
the type string "`CarPaint`" to `ospNewMaterial`. Its parameters are listed
in the table below.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Type   Name                 Default  Description
  ------ ----------------- ----------  ------------------------------------------------------
  vec3f  baseColor          white 0.8  diffuse base reflectivity

  float  roughness                  0  diffuse roughness in [0–1], 0 is perfectly smooth

  float  normal                     1  normal map/scale

  float  flakeDensity               0  density of metallic flakes in [0–1], 0 disables flakes,
                                       1 fully covers the surface with flakes

  float  flakeScale               100  scale of the flake structure, higher values increase
                                       the amount of flakes

  float  flakeSpread              0.3  flake spread in [0–1]

  float  flakeJitter             0.75  flake randomness in [0–1]

  float  flakeRoughness           0.3  flake roughness in [0–1], 0 is perfectly smooth

  float  coat                       1  clear coat layer weight in [0–1]

  float  coatIor                  1.5  clear coat index of refraction

  vec3f  coatColor              white  clear coat color tint

  float  coatThickness              1  clear coat thickness, affects the amount of color
                                       attenuation

  float  coatRoughness              0  clear coat roughness in [0–1], 0 is perfectly smooth

  float  coatNormal                 1  clear coat normal map/scale

  vec3f  flipflopColor          white  reflectivity of coated flakes at grazing angle, used
                                       together with coatColor produces a pearlescent paint

  float  flipflopFalloff            1  flip flop color falloff, 1 disables the flip flop
                                       effect
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  : Parameters of the CarPaint material.

All parameters can be textured by passing a [texture] handle, prefixed
with "`map_`" (e.g., "`map_baseColor`"). [texture transformations] are
supported as well.

![Rendering of a pearlescent CarPaint material.][imgMaterialCarPaint]

#### Metal

The [path tracer] offers a physical metal, supporting changing roughness
and realistic color shifts at edges. To create a Metal material pass the
type string "`Metal`" to `ospNewMaterial`. Its parameters are

  -------- ---------- ----------  --------------------------------------------
  Type     Name          Default  Description
  -------- ---------- ----------  --------------------------------------------
  vec3f[]  ior         Aluminium  [data] array of spectral samples of complex
                                  refractive index, each entry in the form
                                  (wavelength, eta, k), ordered by wavelength
                                  (which is in nm)

  vec3f    eta                    RGB complex refractive index, real part

  vec3f    k                      RGB complex refractive index, imaginary part

  float    roughness         0.1  roughness in [0–1], 0 is perfect mirror
  -------- ---------- ----------  --------------------------------------------
  : Parameters of the Metal material.

The main appearance (mostly the color) of the Metal material is
controlled by the physical parameters `eta` and `k`, the
wavelength-dependent, complex index of refraction. These coefficients
are quite counter-intuitive but can be found in [published
measurements](https://refractiveindex.info/). For accuracy the index of
refraction can be given as an array of spectral samples in `ior`, each
sample a triplet of wavelength (in nm), eta, and k, ordered
monotonically increasing by wavelength; OSPRay will then calculate the
Fresnel in the spectral domain. Alternatively, `eta` and `k` can also be
specified as approximated RGB coefficients; some examples are given in
below table.

  Metal                     eta                   k
  -------------- ----------------------- -----------------
  Ag, Silver      (0.051, 0.043, 0.041)   (5.3, 3.6, 2.3)
  Al, Aluminium   (1.5, 0.98, 0.6)        (7.6, 6.6, 5.4)
  Au, Gold        (0.07, 0.37, 1.5)       (3.7, 2.3, 1.7)
  Cr, Chromium    (3.2, 3.1, 2.3)         (3.3, 3.3, 3.1)
  Cu, Copper      (0.1, 0.8, 1.1)         (3.5, 2.5, 2.4)
  -------------- ----------------------- -----------------
  : Index of refraction of selected metals as approximated RGB
  coefficients, based on data from https://refractiveindex.info/.

The `roughness` parameter controls the variation of microfacets and thus
how polished the metal will look. The roughness can be modified by a
[texture] `map_roughness` ([texture transformations] are supported as
well) to create notable edging effects.

![Rendering of golden Metal material with textured
roughness.][imgMaterialMetal]

#### Alloy

The [path tracer] offers an alloy material, which behaves similar to
[Metal], but allows for more intuitive and flexible control of the
color. To create an Alloy material pass the type string "`Alloy`" to
`ospNewMaterial`. Its parameters are

  Type   Name          Default  Description
  ------ ---------- ----------  --------------------------------------------
  vec3f  color       white 0.9  reflectivity at normal incidence (0 degree)
  vec3f  edgeColor       white  reflectivity at grazing angle (90 degree)
  float  roughness         0.1  roughness, in [0–1], 0 is perfect mirror
  ------ ---------- ----------  --------------------------------------------
  : Parameters of the Alloy material.

The main appearance of the Alloy material is controlled by the parameter
`color`, while `edgeColor` influences the tint of reflections when seen
at grazing angles (for real metals this is always 100% white). If
present, the color component of [geometries] is also used for
reflectivity at normal incidence `color`. As in [Metal] the `roughness`
parameter controls the variation of microfacets and thus how polished
the alloy will look. All parameters can be textured by passing a
[texture] handle, prefixed with "`map_`"; [texture transformations] are
supported as well.

![Rendering of a fictional Alloy material with textured
color.][imgMaterialAlloy]

#### Glass

The [path tracer] offers a realistic a glass material, supporting
refraction and volumetric attenuation (i.e., the transparency color
varies with the geometric thickness). To create a Glass material pass
the type string "`Glass`" to `ospNewMaterial`. Its parameters are

  Type   Name                  Default  Description
  ------ -------------------- --------  -----------------------------------
  float  eta                       1.5  index of refraction
  vec3f  attenuationColor        white  resulting color due to attenuation
  float  attenuationDistance         1  distance affecting attenuation
  ------ -------------------- --------  -----------------------------------
  : Parameters of the Glass material.

For convenience, the rather counter-intuitive physical attenuation
coefficients will be calculated from the user inputs in such a way, that
the `attenuationColor` will be the result when white light traveled
trough a glass of thickness `attenuationDistance`.

![Rendering of a Glass material with orange
attenuation.][imgMaterialGlass]

#### ThinGlass

The [path tracer] offers a thin glass material useful for objects with
just a single surface, most prominently windows. It models a thin,
transparent slab, i.e., it behaves as if a second, virtual surface is
parallel to the real geometric surface. The implementation accounts for
multiple internal reflections between the interfaces (including
attenuation), but neglects parallax effects due to its (virtual)
thickness. To create a such a thin glass material pass the type string
"`ThinGlass`" to `ospNewMaterial`. Its parameters are

  Type      Name                  Default  Description
  --------- -------------------- --------  -----------------------------------
  float     eta                       1.5  index of refraction
  vec3f     attenuationColor        white  resulting color due to attenuation
  float     attenuationDistance         1  distance affecting attenuation
  float     thickness                   1  virtual thickness
  --------- -------------------- --------  -----------------------------------
  : Parameters of the ThinGlass material.

For convenience the attenuation is controlled the same way as with the
[Glass] material. Additionally, the color due to attenuation can be
modulated with a [texture] `map_attenuationColor` ([texture
transformations] are supported as well). If present, the color component
of [geometries] is also used for the attenuation color. The `thickness`
parameter sets the (virtual) thickness and allows for easy exchange of
parameters with the (real) [Glass] material; internally just the ratio
between `attenuationDistance` and `thickness` is used to calculate the
resulting attenuation and thus the material appearance.

![Rendering of a ThinGlass material with red
attenuation.][imgMaterialThinGlass]

![Example image of a colored window made with textured attenuation of
the ThinGlass material.][imgColoredWindow]


#### MetallicPaint

The [path tracer] offers a metallic paint material, consisting of a base
coat with optional flakes and a clear coat. To create a MetallicPaint
material pass the type string "`MetallicPaint`" to `ospNewMaterial`. Its
parameters are listed in the table below.

  Type      Name            Default  Description
  --------- ------------ ----------  ----------------------------------
  vec3f     baseColor     white 0.8  color of base coat
  float     flakeAmount         0.3  amount of flakes, in [0–1]
  vec3f     flakeColor    Aluminium  color of metallic flakes
  float     flakeSpread         0.5  spread of flakes, in [0–1]
  float     eta                 1.5  index of refraction of clear coat
  --------- ------------ ----------  ----------------------------------
  : Parameters of the MetallicPaint material.

The color of the base coat `baseColor` can be textured by a [texture]
`map_baseColor`, which also supports [texture transformations]. If
present, the color component of [geometries] is also used for the color
of the base coat. Parameter `flakeAmount` controls the proportion of
flakes in the base coat, so when setting it to 1 the `baseColor` will
not be visible. The shininess of the metallic component is governed by
`flakeSpread`, which controls the variation of the orientation of the
flakes, similar to the `roughness` parameter of [Metal]. Note that the
effect of the metallic flakes is currently only computed on average,
thus individual flakes are not visible.

![Rendering of a MetallicPaint material.][imgMaterialMetallicPaint]

#### Luminous

The [path tracer] supports the Luminous material which emits light
uniformly in all directions and which can thus be used to turn any
geometric object into a light source. It is created by passing the type
string "`Luminous`" to `ospNewMaterial`. The amount of constant
radiance that is emitted is determined by combining the general
parameters of lights: [`color` and `intensity`](#lights).

  Type   Name          Default  Description
  ------ ------------ --------  ---------------------------------------
  vec3f  color           white  color of the emitted light
  float  intensity           1  intensity of the light (a factor)
  float  transparency        1  material transparency
  ------ ------------ --------  ---------------------------------------
  : Parameters accepted by the Luminous material.

![Rendering of a yellow Luminous material.][imgMaterialLuminous]

### Texture

OSPRay currently implements two texture types (`texture2d` and `volume`)
and is open for extension to other types by applications. More types may
be added in future releases.

To create a new texture use

    OSPTexture ospNewTexture(const char *type);

The call returns `NULL` if the texture could not be created with the
given parameters, or else an `OSPTexture` handle to the created
texture.

#### Texture2D

The `texture2d` texture type implements an image-based texture, where
its parameters are as follows

  Type    Name         Description
  ------- ------------ ----------------------------------
  int     format       `OSPTextureFormat` for the texture
  int     filter       default `OSP_TEXTURE_FILTER_BILINEAR`, alternatively `OSP_TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST`
  OSPData data         the actual texel [data]
  ------- ------------ ----------------------------------
  : Parameters of `texture2d` texture type.

The supported texture formats for `texture2d` are:

  Name                Description
  ------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
  OSP_TEXTURE_RGBA8   8\ bit [0–255] linear components red, green, blue, alpha
  OSP_TEXTURE_SRGBA   8\ bit sRGB gamma encoded color components, and linear alpha
  OSP_TEXTURE_RGBA32F 32\ bit float components red, green, blue, alpha
  OSP_TEXTURE_RGB8    8\ bit [0–255] linear components red, green, blue
  OSP_TEXTURE_SRGB    8\ bit sRGB gamma encoded components red, green, blue
  OSP_TEXTURE_RGB32F  32\ bit float components red, green, blue
  OSP_TEXTURE_R8      8\ bit [0–255] linear single component
  OSP_TEXTURE_RA8     8\ bit [0–255] linear two component
  OSP_TEXTURE_L8      8\ bit [0–255] gamma encoded luminance
  OSP_TEXTURE_LA8     8\ bit [0–255] gamma encoded luminance, and linear alpha
  OSP_TEXTURE_R32F    32\ bit float single component
  ------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
  : Supported texture formats by `texture2d`, i.e., valid constants
  of type `OSPTextureFormat`.

The texel data addressed by `source` starts with the texels in the lower
left corner of the texture image, like in OpenGL. Per default a texture
fetch is filtered by performing bi-linear interpolation of the nearest
2×2 texels; if instead fetching only the nearest texel is desired (i.e.,
no filtering) then pass the `OSP_TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST` flag.

#### TextureVolume

The `volume` texture type implements texture lookups based on 3D world
coordinates of the surface hit point on the associated geometry. If the
given hit point is within the attached volume, the volume is sampled and
classified with the transfer function attached to the volume. This
implements the ability to visualize volume values (as colored by its
transfer function) on arbitrary surfaces inside the volume (as opposed
to an isosurface showing a particular value in the volume). Its
parameters are as follows

  Type      Name         Description
  --------- ------------ -------------------------------------------
  OSPVolume volume       volume used to generate color lookups
  --------- ------------ -------------------------------------------
  : Parameters of `volume` texture type.

TextureVolume can be used for implementing slicing of volumes with any
geometry type. It enables coloring of the slicing geometry with a
different transfer function than that of the sliced volume.

### Texture2D Transformations

All materials with textures also offer to manipulate the placement of
these textures with the help of texture transformations. If so, this
convention shall be used. The following parameters (prefixed with
"`texture_name.`") are combined into one transformation matrix:

  Type   Name         Description
  ------ ------------ ------------------------------------------------------
  vec4f  transform    interpreted as 2×2 matrix (linear part), column-major
  float  rotation     angle in degree, counterclockwise, around center
  vec2f  scale        enlarge texture, relative to center (0.5, 0.5)
  vec2f  translation  move texture in positive direction (right/up)
  ------ ------------ ------------------------------------------------------
  : Parameters to define texture coordinate transformations.

The transformations are applied in the given order. Rotation, scale and
translation are interpreted "texture centric", i.e., their effect seen by
an user are relative to the texture (although the transformations are
applied to the texture coordinates).

### Cameras

To create a new camera of given type `type` use

    OSPCamera ospNewCamera(const char *type);

The call returns `NULL` if that type of camera is not known, or else an
`OSPCamera` handle to the created camera. All cameras accept these
parameters:

  Type   Name        Description
  ------ ----------- ------------------------------------------
  vec3f  position    position of the camera in world-space
  vec3f  direction   main viewing direction of the camera
  vec3f  up          up direction of the camera
  float  nearClip    near clipping distance
  vec2f  imageStart  start of image region (lower left corner)
  vec2f  imageEnd    end of image region (upper right corner)
  ------ ----------- ------------------------------------------
  : Parameters accepted by all cameras.

The camera is placed and oriented in the world with `position`, `direction`
and `up`. OSPRay uses a right-handed coordinate system. The region of the
camera sensor that is rendered to the image can be specified in normalized
screen-space coordinates with `imageStart` (lower left corner) and
`imageEnd` (upper right corner). This can be used, for example, to crop the
image, to achieve asymmetrical view frusta, or to horizontally flip the
image to view scenes which are specified in a left-handed coordinate
system. Note that values outside the default range of [0–1] are valid,
which is useful to easily realize overscan or film gate, or to emulate a
shifted sensor.

#### Perspective Camera

The perspective camera implements a simple thin lens camera for
perspective rendering, supporting optionally depth of field and stereo
rendering, but no motion blur. It is created by passing the type string
"`perspective`" to `ospNewCamera`. In addition to the [general
parameters](#cameras) understood by all cameras the perspective camera
supports the special parameters listed in the table below.

  ----- ---------------------- -----------------------------------------
  Type  Name                   Description
  ----- ---------------------- -----------------------------------------
  float fovy                   the field of view (angle in degree) of
                               the frame's height

  float aspect                 ratio of width by height of the frame
                               (and image region)

  float apertureRadius         size of the aperture, controls the depth
                               of field

  float focusDistance          distance at where the image is sharpest
                               when depth of field is enabled

  bool  architectural          vertical edges are projected to be
                               parallel

  int   stereoMode             0: no stereo (default),
                               1: left eye,
                               2: right eye,
                               3: side-by-side

  float interpupillaryDistance distance between left and right eye when
                               stereo is enabled
  ----- ---------------------- -----------------------------------------
  : Parameters accepted by the perspective camera.

Note that when computing the `aspect` ratio a potentially set image region
(using `imageStart` & `imageEnd`) needs to be regarded as well.

In architectural photography it is often desired for aesthetic reasons
to display the vertical edges of buildings or walls vertically in the
image as well, regardless of how the camera is tilted. Enabling the
`architectural` mode achieves this by internally leveling the camera
parallel to the ground (based on the `up` direction) and then shifting
the lens such that the objects in direction `dir` are centered in the
image. If finer control of the lens shift is needed use `imageStart` &
`imageEnd`. Because the camera is now effectively leveled its image
plane and thus the plane of focus is oriented parallel to the front of
buildings, the whole façade appears sharp, as can be seen in the example
images below.

![Example image created with the perspective camera, featuring depth of
field.][imgCameraPerspective]

![Enabling the `architectural` flag corrects the perspective projection
distortion, resulting in parallel vertical
edges.][imgCameraArchitectural]

![Example 3D stereo image using `stereoMode` side-by-side.][imgCameraStereo]

#### Orthographic Camera

The orthographic camera implements a simple camera with orthographic
projection, without support for depth of field or motion blur. It is
created by passing the type string  "`orthographic`" to `ospNewCamera`.
In addition to the [general parameters](#cameras) understood by all
cameras the orthographic camera supports the following special
parameters:

  Type   Name    Description
  ------ ------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  float  height  size of the camera's image plane in y, in world coordinates
  float  aspect  ratio of width by height of the frame
  ------ ------- ------------------------------------------------------------
  : Parameters accepted by the orthographic camera.

For convenience the size of the camera sensor, and thus the extent of
the scene that is captured in the image, can be controlled with the
`height` parameter. The same effect can be achieved with `imageStart`
and `imageEnd`, and both methods can be combined. In any case, the
`aspect` ratio needs to be set accordingly to get an undistorted image.

![Example image created with the orthographic camera.][imgCameraOrthographic]

#### Panoramic Camera

The panoramic camera implements a simple camera without support for
motion blur. It captures the complete surrounding with a latitude /
longitude mapping and thus the rendered images should best have a ratio
of 2:1. A panoramic camera is created by passing the type string
"`panoramic`" to `ospNewCamera`. It is placed and oriented in the scene
by using the [general parameters](#cameras) understood by all cameras.

![Latitude / longitude map created with the panoramic camera.][imgCameraPanoramic]

### Picking

To get the world-space position of the geometry (if any) seen at [0–1]
normalized screen-space pixel coordinates `screenPos` use

    void ospPick(OSPPickResult *,
                 OSPFrameBuffer,
                 OSPRenderer,
                 OSPCamera,
                 OSPWorld,
                 osp_vec2f screenPos);

The result is returned in the provided `OSPPickResult` struct:

    typedef struct {
        int hasHit;
        osp_vec3f worldPosition;
        OSPGeometricModel GeometricModel;
        uint32_t primID;
    } OSPPickResult;

Note that `ospPick` considers exactly the same camera of the given
renderer that is used to render an image, thus matching results can be
expected. If the camera supports depth of field then the center of the
lens and thus the center of the circle of confusion is used for picking.


Framebuffer
-----------

The framebuffer holds the rendered 2D image (and optionally auxiliary
information associated with pixels). To create a new framebuffer object
of given size `size` (in pixels), color format, and channels use

    OSPFrameBuffer ospNewFrameBuffer(osp_vec2i size,
                                     OSPFrameBufferFormat format = OSP_FB_SRGBA,
                                     uint32_t frameBufferChannels = OSP_FB_COLOR);

The parameter `format` describes the format the color buffer has _on the
host_, and the format that `ospMapFrameBuffer` will eventually return.
Valid values are:

  Name            Description
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------------
  OSP_FB_NONE     framebuffer will not be mapped by the application
  OSP_FB_RGBA8    8\ bit [0–255] linear component red, green, blue, alpha
  OSP_FB_SRGBA    8\ bit sRGB gamma encoded color components, and linear alpha
  OSP_FB_RGBA32F  32\ bit float components red, green, blue, alpha
  --------------- -------------------------------------------------------------
  : Supported color formats of the framebuffer that can be passed to
  `ospNewFrameBuffer`, i.e., valid constants of type
  `OSPFrameBufferFormat`.

The parameter `frameBufferChannels` specifies which channels the
framebuffer holds, and can be combined together by bitwise OR from the
values of `OSPFrameBufferChannel` listed in the table below.

  Name             Description
  ---------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  OSP_FB_COLOR     RGB color including alpha
  OSP_FB_DEPTH     euclidean distance to the camera (_not_ to the image plane), as linear 32\ bit float
  OSP_FB_ACCUM     accumulation buffer for progressive refinement
  OSP_FB_VARIANCE  for estimation of the current noise level if OSP_FB_ACCUM is also present, see [rendering]
  OSP_FB_NORMAL    accumulated world-space normal of the first hit, as vec3f
  OSP_FB_ALBEDO    accumulated material albedo (color without illumination) at the first hit, as vec3f
  ---------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  : Framebuffer channels constants (of type `OSPFrameBufferChannel`),
  naming optional information the framebuffer can store. These values
  can be combined by bitwise OR when passed to `ospNewFrameBuffer`.

If a certain channel value is _not_ specified, the given buffer channel
will not be present. Note that OSPRay makes a clear distinction
between the _external_ format of the framebuffer and the internal one:
The external format is the format the user specifies in the `format`
parameter; it specifies what color format OSPRay will eventually
_return_ the framebuffer to the application (when calling
`ospMapFrameBuffer`): no matter what OSPRay uses internally, it will
simply return a 2D array of pixels of that format, with possibly all
kinds of reformatting, compression/decompression, etc., going on
in-between the generation of the _internal_ framebuffer and the mapping
of the externally visible one.

In particular, `OSP_FB_NONE` is a perfectly valid pixel format for a
framebuffer that an application will never map. For example, an
application driving a display wall may well generate an intermediate
framebuffer and eventually transfer its pixel to the individual displays
using an `OSPPixelOp` [pixel operation].

The application can map the given channel of a framebuffer – and thus
access the stored pixel information – via

    const void *ospMapFrameBuffer(OSPFrameBuffer,
                                  OSPFrameBufferChannel = OSP_FB_COLOR);

Note that `OSP_FB_ACCUM` or `OSP_FB_VARIANCE` cannot be mapped. The
origin of the screen coordinate system in OSPRay is the lower left
corner (as in OpenGL), thus the first pixel addressed by the returned
pointer is the lower left pixel of the image.

A previously mapped channel of a framebuffer can be unmapped by passing
the received pointer `mapped` to

    void ospUnmapFrameBuffer(const void *mapped, OSPFrameBuffer);

The individual channels of a framebuffer can be cleared with

    void ospResetAccumulation(OSPFrameBuffer);

This function will clear *all* accumulating buffers (`OSP_FB_VARIANCE`,
`OSP_FB_NORMAL`, and `OSP_FB_ALBEDO`, if present) and resets the
accumulation counter `accumID`. It is unspecified if the existing color and
depth buffers are physically cleared when `ospResetAccumulation` is called.

If `OSP_FB_VARIANCE` is specified, an estimate of the variance of the last
accumulated frame can be queried with

    float ospGetVariance(OSPFrameBuffer);

Note this value is only updated after synchronizing with `OSP_FRAME_FINISHED`,
as further described in [asynchronous rendering].

The framebuffer takes a list of pixel operations to be applied to the image
in sequence as an `OSPData`. The pixel operations will be run in the order
they are in the array.

  Type                 Name            Description
  -------------------- --------------- ---------------------------------------
  OSPImageOperation[]  imageOperation  ordered sequence of image operations
  -------------------- --------------- ---------------------------------------
  : Parameters accepted by the framebuffer.


### Pixel Operation {-}

Pixel operations are functions that are applied to every pixel that
gets written into a framebuffer. Examples include post-processing,
filtering, blending, tone mapping, or sending tiles to a display wall.
To create a new pixel operation of given type `type` use

    OSPPixelOp ospNewPixelOp(const char *type);

The call returns `NULL` if that type is not known, or else an
`OSPPixelOp` handle to the created pixel operation.

#### Tone Mapper {-}

The tone mapper is a pixel operation which implements a generic filmic tone
mapping operator. Using the default parameters it approximates the Academy
Color Encoding System (ACES). The tone mapper is created by passing the type
string "`tonemapper`" to `ospNewPixelOp`. The tone mapping curve can be
customized using the parameters listed in the table below.

  ----- ---------  --------    -----------------------------------------
  Type  Name       Default     Description
  ----- ---------  --------    -----------------------------------------
  float exposure   1.0         amount of light per unit area

  float contrast   1.6773      contrast (toe of the curve); typically is
                               in [1–2]

  float shoulder   0.9714      highlight compression (shoulder of the
                               curve); typically is in [0.9–1]

  float midIn      0.18        mid-level anchor input; default is 18%
                               gray

  float midOut     0.18        mid-level anchor output; default is 18%
                               gray

  float hdrMax     11.0785     maximum HDR input that is not clipped

  bool  acesColor  true        apply the ACES color transforms
  ----- ---------  --------    -----------------------------------------
  : Parameters accepted by the tone mapper.

To use the popular "Uncharted 2" filmic tone mapping curve instead, set the
parameters to the values listed in the table below.

  Name       Value
  ---------  --------
  contrast   1.1759
  shoulder   0.9746
  midIn      0.18
  midOut     0.18
  hdrMax     6.3704
  acesColor  false
  ---------  --------
  : Filmic tone mapping curve parameters. Note that the curve includes an
  exposure bias to match 18% middle gray.

Rendering
---------

### Asynchronous Rendering

Rendering is by default asynchronous (non-blocking), and is done by
combining a frame buffer, renderer, camera, and world.

What to render and how to render it depends on the renderer's
parameters. If the framebuffer supports accumulation (i.e., it was
created with `OSP_FB_ACCUM`) then successive calls to `ospRenderFrame`
will progressively refine the rendered image. If additionally the
framebuffer has an `OSP_FB_VARIANCE` channel then `ospRenderFrame`
returns an estimate of the current variance of the rendered image,
otherwise `inf` is returned. The estimated variance can be used by the
application as a quality indicator and thus to decide whether to stop or
to continue progressive rendering.

To start an render task, use

    OSPFuture ospRenderFrame(OSPFrameBuffer,
                             OSPRenderer,
                             OSPCamera,
                             OSPWorld);

This returns an `OSPFuture` handle, which can be used to
synchronize with the application, cancel, or query for progress of the
running task. When `ospRenderFrame` is called, there is no guarantee
when the associated task will begin execution.

Progress of a running frame can be queried with the following API
function

    float ospGetProgress(OSPFuture);

This returns the progress of the task in [0-1].

Applications can wait on the result of an asynchronous operation, or
choose to only synchronize with a specific event. To synchronize with an
`OSPFuture` use

    void ospWait(OSPFuture, OSPSyncEvent = OSP_TASK_FINISHED);

The following are values which can be synchronized with the application

  -------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  Name                 Description
  -------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  OSP_NONE_FINISHED    Don't wait for anything to be finished (immediately
                       return from `ospWait`)

  OSP_WORLD_COMMITTED  Wait for the world to be committed (not yet implemented)

  OSP_WORLD_RENDERED   Wait for the world to be rendered, but not
                       post-processing operations (Pixel/Tile/Frame Op)

  OSP_FRAME_FINISHED   Wait for all rendering operations to complete

  OSP_TASK_FINISHED    Wait on full completion of the task associated with
                       the future. The underlying task may involve one or
                       more of the above synchronization events
  -------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  : Supported events that can be passed to `ospWait`

Currently only rendering can be invoked asynchronously. However, future
releases of OSPRay may add more asynchronous versions of API calls (and
thus return `OSPFuture`).

Applications can query whether particular events are complete with

    int ospIsReady(OSPFuture, OSPSyncEvent = OSP_TASK_FINISHED);

As the given running task runs (as tracked by the `OSPFuture`),
applications can query a boolean [0,1] result if the passed event has
been completed.

### Asynchronously Rendering and ospCommit()

The use of either `ospRenderFrame` or `ospRenderFrame` requires
that all objects in the scene being rendered have been committed before
rendering occurs. If a call to `ospCommit()` happens while a frame is
rendered, the result is undefined behavior and should be avoided.

### Synchronous Rendering

For convenience in certain use cases, `ospray_util.h` provides a
synchronous version of `ospRenderFrame`:

    float ospRenderFrameBlocking(OSPFrameBuffer,
                                 OSPRenderer,
                                 OSPCamera,
                                 OSPWorld);

This version is the equivalent of:

    - `ospRenderFrame`
    - `ospWait(f, OSP_TASK_FINISHED)`
    - return `ospGetVariance(fb)`

This version is closest to `ospRenderFrame` from OSPRay v1.x.
