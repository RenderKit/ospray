# NOTE: This CMakeLists.txt is intended to be used to exercise an OSPRay
#       install and demonstrate how external applications can build against
#       OSPRay using CMake.
#
#       Once you have done a 'make install' of an existing OSPRay
#       build (will install to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX), create a separate build
#       directory and invoke CMake on this directory. If you have 'ospray_DIR'
#       setup correctly to point to where you just installed OSPRay, then this
#       should build the ospTutorial app from that install and NOT use your
#       local build.
