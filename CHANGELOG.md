    texture can be used for slicing (see tutorial
    `ospTutorialStructuredVolume` for reference)
-   Addition of version query support for the API

### Changes in v1.8.5:

-   Fix float precision cornercase (`NaN`s) in sphere light sampling
-   Fix CMake bug that assumed `.git` was a directory, which is not true
    when using OSPRay as a git submodule
-   Fix CMake warning
-   Fix `DLL_EXPORT` issue with `ospray_testing` helper library on
    Windows

### Changes in v1.8.4:

-   Add location of `libospray` to paths searched to find modules

### Changes in v1.8.3:

-   Fix bug where parameters set by `ospSet1b()` were being ignored
-   Fix bug in box intersection tests possibly creating `NaN`s
-   Fix issue with client applications calling `find_package(ospray)`
    more than once
-   Fix bug in cylinder intersection when ray and cylinder are
    perpendicular
-   Fix rare crash in path tracer / MultiBSDF

### Changes in v1.8.2:

-   CMake bug fix where external users of OSPRay needed CMake newer than
    version 3.1
-   Fix incorrect propagation of tasking system flags from an OSPRay
    install
-   Fix inconsistency between supported environment variables and
    command line parameters passed to `ospInit()`
    -   Missing variables were `OSPRAY_LOAD_MODULES` and
        `OSPRAY_DEFAULT_DEVICE`

### Changes in v1.8.1:

-   CMake bug fix to remove full paths to dependencies in packages

### Changes in v1.8.0:

-   This will be the last minor revision of OSPRay. Future development
    effort in the `devel` branch will be dedicated to v2.0 API changes
    and may break existing v1.x applications.
    -   This will also be the last version of OSPRay to include
        `ospray_sg` and the Example Viewer. Users which depend on these
        should instead use the separate OSPRay Studio project, where
        `ospray_sg` will be migrated.
    -   We will continue to support patch releases of v1.8.x in case of
        any reported bugs
-   Refactored CMake to use newer CMake concepts
    -   All targets are now exported in OSPRay installs and can be
        consumed by client projects with associated includes, libraries,
        and definitions
    -   OSPRay now requires CMake v3.1 to build
    -   See documentation for more details
-   Added new minimal tutorial apps to replace the more complex Example
    Viewer
-   Added new "`subdivision`" geometry type to support subdivision
    surfaces
-   Added support for texture formats `L8`, `LA8` (gamma-encoded
    luminance), and `RA8` (linear two component). Note that the enum
    `OSP_TEXTURE_FORMAT_INVALID` changed its value, thus recompilation
    may be necessary.
-   Automatic epsilon handling, which removes the "`epsilon`" parameter
    on all renderers
-   Normals in framebuffer channel `OSP_FB_NORMAL` are now in
    world-space
-   Added support for Intel® Open Image Denoise to the Example Viewer
    -   This same integration will soon be ported to OSPRay Studio
-   Fixed artifacts for scaled instances of spheres, cylinders and
    streamlines
-   Improvements to precision of intersections with cylinders and
    streamlines
-   Fixed Quadlight: the emitting side is now indeed in direction
    `edge1`×`edge2`

### Changes in v1.7.3:

-   Make sure a "`default`" device can always be created
-   Fixed `ospNewTexture2D` (completely implementing old behavior)
-   Cleanup any shared object handles from the OS created from
    `ospLoadModule()`

### Changes in v1.7.2:

-   Fixed issue in `mpi_offload` device where `ospRelease` would
    sometimes not correctly free objects
-   Fixed issue in `ospray_sg` where structured volumes would not
    properly release the underlying OSPRay object handles

### Changes in v1.7.1:

-   Fixed issue where the `Principled` material would sometimes show up
    incorrectly as black
-   Fixed issue where some headers were missing from install packages

### Changes in v1.7.0:

-   Generalized texture interface to support more than classic 2D image
    textures, thus `OSPTexture2D` and `ospNewTexture2D` are now
    deprecated, use the new API call `ospNewTexture("texture2d")`
    instead
    -   Added new `volume` texture type to visualize volume data on
        arbitrary geometry placed inside the volume
-   Added new framebuffer channels `OSP_FB_NORMAL` and `OSP_FB_ALBEDO`
-   Applications can get information about the progress of rendering the
    current frame, and optionally cancel it, by registering a callback
    function via `ospSetProgressFunc()`
-   Lights are not tied to the renderer type, so a new function
    `ospNewLight3()` was introduced to implement this. Please convert
    all uses of `ospNewLight()` and/or `ospNewLight2()` to
    `ospNewLight3()`
-   Added sheenTint parameter to Principled material
-   Added baseNormal parameter to Principled material
-   Added low-discrepancy sampling to path tracer
-   The `spp` parameter on the renderer no longer supports values less
    than 1, instead applications should render to a separate, lower
    resolution framebuffer during interaction to achieve the same
    behavior

### Changes in v1.6.1:

    -   Quad mesh interpolation and sampling
    -   Normal mapping in path tracer materials

        memory/performance trade-off for applications
-   Implemented "`quads`" geometry type to handle quads directly
-   Implemented the ability to set "void" cell values in all volume
    types: when `NaN` is present as a volume's cell value the volume
    sample will be ignored by the SciVis renderer
-   Fixed support for color strides which were not multiples of
    `sizeof(float)`
-   Added support for RGBA8 color format to spheres, which can be set by
    specifying the "`color_format`" parameter as `OSP_UCHAR4`, or
    passing the "`color`" array through an `OSPData` of type
    `OSP_UCHAR4`.
-   Added ability to configure Embree scene flags via `OSPModel`
    parameters
-   `ospFreeFrameBuffer()` has been deprecated in favor of using
    `ospRelease()` to free framebuffer handles

### Changes in v1.5.0:

-   Unstructured tetrahedral volume now generalized to also support
    hexahedral data, now called `unstructured_volume`

        was not created via `--osp:mpi` or `--osp:device:[name]`
-   MPI devices can now accept an existing world communicator instead of
    always creating their own
-   Added ability to control ISPC specific optimization flags via CMake
    options. See the various `ISPC_FLAGS_*` variables to control which
    flags get used
-   Enhancements to sample applications
    -   `ospray_sg` (and thus `ospExampleViewer`/`ospBenchmark`) can now
        be extended with new scene data importers via modules or the SDK

        `spp` <= 0
    -   Fixed an issue in `ospExampleViewer` when specifying multiple data
        files
-   The C99 tutorial is now indicated as the default; the C++ wrappers
    do not change the semantics of the API (memory management) so the
    C99 version should be considered first when learning the API

-   Several cleanups and bug fixes
    -   Improved precision of ray intersection with streamlines,
        spheres, and cylinder geometries

    `mpi_distributed` devices through improvements to the `mpi_common`
    and `mpi_maml` infrastructure libraries
-   Major sample app cleanups
    -   `ospray_sg` library is the new basis for building apps, which is
        a scene graph implementation
    -   Old (unused) libraries have been removed: miniSG, command line,
        importer, loaders, and scripting
    -   Some removed functionality (such as scripting) may be
        reintroduced in the new infrastructure later, though most
        features have remained and have been improved
    -   Optional improved texture loading has been transitioned from
        ImageMagick to OpenImageIO

    `OSPRAY_INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES` enabled

### Changes in v1.3.0:

-   New MPI distributed device to support MPI distributed applications
    using OSPRay collectively for "in-situ" rendering (currently in
    "alpha")
    -   Enabled via new `mpi_distributed` device type
    -   Currently only supports `raycast` renderer, other renderers will
        be supported in the future
    -   All API calls are expected to be exactly replicated (object
        instances and parameters) except scene data (geometries and
        volumes)
    -   The original MPI device is now called the `mpi_offload` device
        to differentiate between the two implementations
-   Support of Intel® AVX-512 for next generation Intel® Xeon® processor
    (codename Skylake), thus new minimum ISPC version is 1.9.1
-   Thread affinity of OSPRay's tasking system can now be controlled via
    either device parameter `setAffinity`, or command line parameter
    `osp:setaffinity`, or environment variable `OSPRAY_SET_AFFINITY`
-   Changed behavior of the background color in the SciVis renderer:
    `bgColor` now includes alpha and is always blended (no
    `backgroundEnabled` anymore). To disable the background do not set
    `bgColor`, or set it to transparent black (0, 0, 0, 0)
-   Geometries "`spheres`" and "`cylinders`" now support texture
    coordinates
-   The GLUT- and Qt-based demo viewer applications have been replaced
    by an example viewer with minimal dependencies
    -   Building the sample applications now requires GCC 4.9
        (previously 4.8) for features used in the C++ standard library;
        OSPRay itself can still be built with GCC 4.8
    -   The new example viewer based on `ospray::sg` (called
        `ospExampleViewerSg`) is the single application we are
        consolidating to, `ospExampleViewer` will remain only as a
        deprecated viewer for compatibility with the old `ospGlutViewer`
        application
-   Deprecated `ospCreateDevice()`; use `ospNewDevice()` instead
-   Improved error handling
    -   Various API functions now return an `OSPError` value
    -   `ospDeviceSetStatusFunc()` replaces the deprecated
        `ospDeviceSetErrorMsgFunc()`
    -   New API functions to query the last error
        (`ospDeviceGetLastErrorCode()` and `ospDeviceGetLastErrorMsg()`)
        or to register an error callback with `ospDeviceSetErrorFunc()`
    -   Fixed bug where exceptions could leak to C applications

### Changes in v1.2.1:

    on Windows, and other build related issues

### Changes in v1.2.0:

-   Added support for volumes with voxelType `short` (16-bit signed
    integers). Applications need to recompile, because `OSPDataType` has
    been re-enumerated
-   Removed SciVis renderer parameter `aoWeight`, the intensity (and now
    color as well) of AO is controlled via "`ambient`" lights. If
    `aoSamples` is zero (the default) then ambient lights cause ambient
    illumination (without occlusion)
-   New SciVis renderer parameter `aoTransparencyEnabled`, controlling
    whether object transparency is respected when computing ambient
    occlusion (disabled by default, as it is considerable slower)
-   Implement normal mapping for SciVis renderer
-   Support of emissive (and illuminating) geometries in the path tracer
    via new material "`Luminous`"

    -   Devices can be created and set current, creating an alternative
        method for initializing the API
    -   New API functions for committing parameters on Devices
-   Removed support for the first generation Intel® Xeon Phi™ coprocessor
    (codename Knights Corner)
-   Other minor improvements, updates, and bug fixes
    -   Updated Embree required version to v2.13.0 for added features
        and performance
    -   New API function `ospDeviceSetErrorMsgFunc()` to specify a
        callback for handling message outputs from OSPRay
    -   Added ability to remove user set parameter values with new
        `ospRemoveParam()` API function
    -   The MPI device is now provided via a module, removing the need
        for having separately compiled versions of OSPRay with and
        without MPI
    -   OSPRay build dependencies now only get installed if
        `OSPRAY_INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES` CMake variable is enabled

### Changes in v1.1.2:

-   Various bug fixes related to normalization, epsilons and debug
    messages

### Changes in v1.1.1:

    -   Option `architectural` in perspective camera, rectifying
        vertical edges to appear parallel
    -   Rendering a subsection of the full view with
        `imageStart`/`imageEnd` supported by all cameras
-   This will be our last release supporting the first generation Intel
    Xeon Phi coprocessor (codename Knights Corner)
    -   Future major and minor releases will be upgraded to the latest
        version of Embree, which no longer supports Knights Corner
    -   Depending on user feedback, patch releases are still made to
        fix bugs
-   Enhanced output statistics in `ospBenchmark` application
-   Many fixes to the OSPRay SDK
    -   Improved CMake detection of compile-time enabled features

    -   Tested with GCC v5.3.1 and Clang v3.8
    -   Sample applications and modules have not been fixed yet, thus
        applications which build OSPRay as a CMake subproject should
        disable them with `-DOSPRAY_ENABLE_APPS=OFF` and
        `-DOSPRAY_ENABLE_MODULES=OFF`

        -   CMake clients use them by calling
            `include(${OSPRAY_USE_FILE})` in their CMake code after
            calling `find_package(ospray)`
    -   New OSPRay C++ wrapper classes
        -   These act as a thin layer on top of OSPRay object handles,
            where multiple wrappers will share the same underlying
            handle when assigned, copied, or moved
        -   New OSPRay objects are only created when a class instance is
            explicitly constructed
        -   C++ users are encouraged to use these over the `ospray.h`
            API
-   Complete rework of sample applications
    -   New shared code for parsing the `commandline`
    -   Save/load of transfer functions now handled through a separate

    `OSPRAY_BUILD_ISA` CMake build configuration
    -   Compiling AVX-512 requires icc to be enabled as a build option
-   Enhanced error messages when `ospLoadModule()` fails
-   Added `OSP_FB_RGBA32F` support in the `DistributedFrameBuffer`
-   Updated Glass shader in the path tracer

-   Fixed support of first generation Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor
    (codename Knights Corner)
-   Restored missing implementation of `ospRemoveVolume()`

### Changes in v0.10.0:

-   Added new tasking options: `Cilk`, `Internal`, and `Debug`
    -   Provides more ways for OSPRay to interact with calling
        application tasking systems
        - `Cilk`: Use Intel® Cilk™ Plus language extensions (icc only)
        - `Internal`: Use hand written OSPRay tasking system
        - `Debug`: All tasks are run in serial (useful for debugging)
    -   In most cases, Intel Threading Building Blocks (Intel `TBB`)
        remains the fastest option

        the rendered image if the framebuffer was created with the
        `OSP_FB_VARIANCE` channel
    -   If the renderer parameter `varianceThreshold` is set,
        progressive refinement concentrates on regions of the image with
        a variance higher than this threshold
-   Added support for volumes with voxelType `ushort` (16-bit unsigned
    integers)
-   `OSPTexture2D` now supports sRGB formats -- actually most images are
    stored in sRGB. As a consequence the API call `ospNewTexture2D()`
    needed to change to accept the new `OSPTextureFormat` parameter
-   Similarly, OSPRay's framebuffer types now also distinguishes between
    linear and sRGB 8-bit formats. The new types are `OSP_FB_NONE`,
    `OSP_FB_RGBA8`, `OSP_FB_SRGBA`, and `OSP_FB_RGBA32F`
-   Changed "scivis" renderer parameter defaults
    -   All shading (AO + shadows) must be explicitly enabled
-   OSPRay can now use a newer, pre-installed Embree enabled by the new
    `OSPRAY_USE_EXTERNAL_EMBREE` CMake option

    -   Various robustness changes made in CMake to make it easier to
        compile OSPRay

### Changes in v0.9.1:

-   Volume rendering now integrated into the "scivis" renderer
    -   Volumes are rendered in the same way the "dvr" volume renderer
        renders them
    -   Ambient occlusion works with implicit isosurfaces, with a known
        visual quality/performance trade-off
-   Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor (codename Knights Corner) COI device and
    build infrastructure restored (volume rendering is known to still be
    broken)
-   New support for CPack built OSPRay binary redistributable packages

    rendering
-   New SciVis-focused renderer ("raytracer" or "scivis") combining
    functionality of "obj" and "ao" renderers
    -   Ambient occlusion is quite flexible: dynamic number of samples,
        maximum ray distance, and weight
-   Updated Embree version to v2.7.1 with native support for Intel
    AVX-512 for triangle mesh surface rendering on the Intel Xeon Phi
    processor (codename Knights Landing)

    OSPRay-rendered content
    -   Renderers support early ray termination through a maximum depth
        parameter
    -   New OpenGL utility module to convert between OSPRay and OpenGL
        depth values
-   Added panoramic and orthographic camera types
-   Proper CMake-based installation of OSPRay and CMake `find_package()`
    support for use in external projects
-   Experimental Windows support
-   Deprecated `ospNewTriangleMesh()`; use `ospNewGeometry("triangles")`
    instead
-   Bug fixes and cleanups throughout the codebase

### Changes in v0.8.2:

-   Initial support for Intel AVX-512 and the Intel Xeon Phi processor
    (codename Knights Landing)
-   Performance improvements to the volume renderer
-   Incorporated implicit slices and isosurfaces of volumes as core
    geometry types
-   Added support for multiple disjoint volumes to the volume renderer
-   Improved performance of `ospSetRegion()`, reducing volume load times
-   Improved large data handling for the `shared_structured_volume` and
    `block_bricked_volume` volume types
-   Added support for DDS horizon data to the seismic module
-   Initial support in the Qt viewer for volume rendering
-   Updated to ISPC 1.8.2
-   Various bug fixes, cleanups and documentation updates throughout the
    codebase

### Changes in v0.8.1:

-   The volume renderer and volume viewer can now be run MPI parallel
    (data replicated) using the `--osp:mpi` command line option
-   Improved performance of volume grid accelerator generation, reducing
    load times for large volumes
-   The volume renderer and volume viewer now properly handle multiple
    isosurfaces
-   Added small example tutorial demonstrating how to use OSPRay
-   Several fixes to support older versions of GCC
-   Bug fixes to `ospSetRegion()` implementation for arbitrarily shaped
    regions and setting large volumes in a single call
-   Bug fix for geometries with invalid bounds; fixes streamline and
    sphere rendering in some scenes
-   Fixed bug in depth buffer generation

### Changes in v0.8.0:

-   Incorporated early version of a new Qt-based viewer to eventually
    unify (and replace) the existing simpler GLUT-based viewers
-   Added new path tracing renderer (`ospray/render/pathtracer`),
-   roughly based on the Embree sample path tracer
-   Added new features to the volume renderer
    -   Gradient shading (lighting)
    -   Implicit isosurfacing
    -   Progressive refinement
    -   Support for regular grids, specified with the `gridOrigin` and
        `gridSpacing` parameters
    -   New `shared_structured_volume` volume type that allows voxel
        data to be provided by applications through a shared data buffer
    -   New API call to set (sub-)regions of volume data (`ospSetRegion()`)
-   Added a subsampling-mode, enabled with a negative `spp` parameter;
    the first frame after scene changes is rendered with reduced
    resolution, increasing interactivity
-   Added multi-target ISA support: OSPRay will now select the
    appropriate ISA at runtime
-   Added support for the Stanford SEP file format to the seismic
    module
-   Added `--osp:numthreads <n>` command line option to restrict the
    number of threads OSPRay creates
