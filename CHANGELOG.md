Version History
---------------

### Changes in v2.6.0:

-   Added new `intensityQuantity` type `OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_SCALE`
    for the `hdri` and `sunSky` light source. For the future this is the
    only supported quantity for these lights, the value
    `OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_RADIANCE` is deprecated. When
    `OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_SCALE` is used for `sunSky` the default
    value of `intensity` is `0.025` to match the old behaviour
-   The MPI module is included in the releases packages. An
    [MPICH-ABI](https://www.mpich.org/abi/) compatible build is provided
    for Linux that can be run with the Intel oneAPI HPC Toolki, MPICH,
    and other MPICH-ABI compatible MPI distributions. The Windows
    release is built against MPI provided in the Intel oneAPI HPC
    Toolkit
-   OSPRay now requires minimum Open VKL v0.13.0 to bring the
    following improvements:
    -   Support half precision float (fp16) voxel data in strutured
        volumes (regular and spherical) and VDB volume
    -   Supporting tricubic filtering via `VKL_FILTER_TRICUBIC` filter
        for VDB volume
    -   Fixed artifacts for isosurfaces of unstructured volumes
    -   Performance improvements for isosurfaces when multiple
        isovalues are selected 
    -   Better, adaptive sampling of AMR volumes
-   The `mpiOffload` and `mpiDistributed` devices now support picking.
    Picking in the distributed device will return the globally closest
    object on the rank that owns that object. Other ranks will report
    no hit
-   Messages issued from ISPC code use the same reporting path as the C++
    code, thus now the whole OSPRay console output can be consistently
    filtered with log levels
-   Open VKL and Embree internal errors are now correctly mapped to
    their corresponding OSPRay errors
-   Fix behavior of committing the framebuffer in distributed rendering
    to match that of local rendering

### Changes in v2.5.0:

-   Add native support for cones or cylinders with curves geometry of
    type `OSP_DISJOINT`, requiring minimum version 3.12.0 of Embree
-   Replaced OSPRay's internal implementation of round linear curves by
    Embree's native implementation. Internal surfaces at joints are now
    correctly removed, leading to higher quality renderings with
    transparency, at the cost of intersection performance
-   SciVis renderer improvements:
    -   Colored transparency, colored shadows
    -   Light sources are visible including HDRI Light environment map
-   The MPI module is now distributed as part of OSPRay in the modules
    directory
    -   The socket-based communication layer has been removed
-   Add `intensityQuantity` parameter to light sources to control the
    interpretation and conversion of the `intensity` into a radiative
    quantity
-   OSPRay now requires minimum Open VKL v0.12.0 to bring the following
    improvements: 
    -   Better default sampling rate for scaled volumes, improving
        performance
    -   Higher robustness for axis-aligned rays
-   Removed limit on the number of volumes (both overlapped and separate)
    that a ray can intersect while rendering. Now it is limited by
    available memory only.
-   Move to OIDN v1.3.0 to bring the following improvements:
    -   Improved denoising quality (sharpness of fine details, fewer
        noisy artifacts)
    -   Slightly improved performance and lower memory consumption
-   Both geometric and volumetric models can now have their child
    geometry/volume objects rebound using an object parameter
-   Fix light leaking artifacts at poles of HDRI (and Sun-Sky) light
-   Add sRGB conversion to `ospExamples` such that the color of the
    widget for `backgroundColor` actually matches 
-   Dropping support for MSVC14, new minimum compiler on Windows is
    MSVC15 (Visual Studio 2017)

### Changes in v2.4.0:

-   The pathtracer optionally allows for alpha blending even if the
    background is seen through refractive objects like glass, by
    enabling `backgroundRefraction`
-   OSPRay now requires minimum Open VKL v0.11.0 to bring the following
    improvements: 
    -   Improved rendering performance of VDB volumes
    -   Added support for configurable iterator depth via the
        `maxIteratorDepth` parameters for unstructured and particle
        volumes, improved performance
    -   Added support for filter modes for structured volumes (regular
        and spherical)
-   Expose parameter `horizonExtension` of Sun-sky light, which extends
    the sky dome by stretching the horizon over the lower hemisphere
-   Optimize handling of geometry lights by the pathtracer
-   The optional `denoiser` image operation now respects frame
    cancellation, requiring IntelÂ® Open Image Denoise with minimum
    version 1.2.3
-   Fixed normals of (transformed) isosurfaces
-   Robust calculation of normals of `boxes` geometry
-   Clipping geometry is now working correctly with `map_maxDepth`
    renderer parameter
-   Using materials in a renderer with a mismatched `renderer_type` no
    longer causes crashes while rendering
-   Significant improvements have been made to loading performance in
    the MPI Offload device. Applications which make large numbers of API
    calls or create many smaller geometries or volumes should see
    substantial load time improvements.
-   MPI module compacts strided data arrays on the app rank before
    sending

### Changes in v2.3.0:

-   Re-add SciVis renderer features (the previous version is still
    available as `ao` renderer)
    -   Lights are regarded, and thus the OBJ material terms `ks` and
        `ns` have effect again
    -   Hard shadows are enabled via the `shadows` parameter
    -   The control of ambient occlusion changed:
        -   The `aoIntensity` parameter is replaced by the combined
            intensity of ambient lights in the `World`
        -   The effect range is controlled via `aoDistance`
-   Added support for data arrays with a stride between voxels in
    volumes
-   Application thread waiting for finished image via `ospWait`
    participates in rendering, increasing CPU utilization; via
    rkcommon v1.5.0
-   Added `ospray_cpp` compatibility headers for C++ wrappers to
    understand rkcommon and glm short vector types
    -   For rkcommon, include `ospray/ospray_cpp/ext/rkcommon.h`
    -   For glm, include `ospray/ospray_cpp/ext/glm.h`
    -   Note in debug builds some compilers will not optimize out type
        trait definitions. This will require users to manually
        instantiate the glm definitions in one translation unit within
        the application using `#define OSPRAY_GLM_DEFINITIONS` before
        including `ext/glm.h`: see `ospTutorialGLM` as an example
-   Changed parameters to `volume` texture: it now directly accepts the
    `volume` and the `transferFunction`
-   Fixed many memory leaks
-   Handle `NaN` during volume sampling, which led to bounding boxes
    being visible for some volumes and settings
-   Depth is now "accumulated" as well, using the minimum
-   Fix shading for multiple modes of the `debug` renderer
-   New minimum ISPC version is 1.14.1

### Changes in v2.2.0:

-   Support for texture transformation in SciVis OBJ material
-   Add transformations for volume textures; volume texture lookups are
    now with local object coordinates (not world coordinates anymore)
-   Changed behavior: if solely a texture is given, then the default
    value of the corresponding parameter is *not* multiplied
-   Support for better antialiasing using a set of different pixel
    filters (e.g, box, Gaussian, ...). The size of the pixel filter is
    defined by the used filter type. Previously OSPRay implicitly used a
    box filter with a size of 1, for better results the default filter
    is now `OSP_PIXELFILTER_GAUSS`
-   Support stereo3d mode for panoramic camera
-   Add new camera `stereoMode` `OSP_STEREO_TOP_BOTTOM` (with left eye
    at top half of the image)
-   Added support for random light sampling to the `pathtracer`, the
    number of sampled light sources per path vertex is defined by the
    `lightSamples` parameter
-   Support ring light by extending spot with `innerRadius`
-   Fixed nonphysical behavior of the `spot` and `sphere` light sources
    -   for area lights (when `radius > 0`) surfaces close to the light
        will be darker
    -   the `spot` now has an angular falloff, such that a disk light is
        a proper lambertian area light, which leads to darker regions
        perpendicular to its direction (thus barely visible with a
        typically small `openingAngle`)
-   Support for Open VKL v0.10.0 and its new sampler object API, thus
    this is now the required minimum version
-   Added support for particle and VDB volumes
-   Move from `ospcommon` to `rkcommon` v1.4.2
-   New minimum ISPC version is 1.10.0
-   Status and error callbacks now support a user pointer
-   Enabled C++ wrappers (`ospray_cpp`) to work with non-rkcommon math
    types
    -   Note that while the C API remains the same, the C++ wrappers
        will require some application updates to account for these
        changes
-   MPI module improved parallelism of framebuffer compression &
    decompression when collecting the final framebuffer to the head
    rank. This provides a substantial performance improvement when using
    just a few ranks or large framebuffers (both in pixel count or
    channel count).
-   The MPI module will now default to setting thread affinity off, if
    no option is selected. This improves thread usage and core
    assignment of threads in most cases, where no specific options are
    provided to the MPI runtime.
-   Fix bug where `ospGetCurrentDevice` would crash if used before
    `ospInit`
-   Allow `NULL` handles to be passed to `ospDeviceRetain` and
    `ospDeviceRelease`
-   ISPC generated headers containing the exported functions for
    OSPRay's ISPC types and functions are now distributed with the SDK
-   Add CarPaint `flakeColor` parameter, defaults to current Aluminium
-   Fixed Debug build (which were producing different images)
-   The path tracer now also regards the renderer materialist when
    creating geometry lights
-   Fix bug where OSPObject handles where not translated to worker-local
    pointers when committing an OSPData in the MPIOffloadDevice.
-   MPI module: Fix handling of `OSP_STRING` parameters

### Changes in v2.1.1:

-   CarPaint material obeys `coat` weight parameter
-   Correct depth buffer values with SciVis renderer
-   Adaptions to Embree v3.10.0
-   The Linux binary release finds `ospcommon` again

### Changes in v2.1.0:

-   New clipping geometries feature that allows clipping any scene
    (geometry and volumes); all OSPRay geometry types can by used as
    clipping geometry
    -   Inverted clipping is supported via new `invertNormals` parameter
        of `GeometricModel`
    -   Currently there is a fixed upper limit (64) of how many clipping
        geometries can be nested
    -   When clipping with curves geometry (any basis except linear)
        some rendering artifacts may appear
-   New plane geometry defined via plane equation and optional bounding
    box
-   Sun-sky light based on physical model of HoÅ¡ek-Wilkie
-   Support for photometric lights (e.g., IES or EULUMDAT)
-   Add new `ospGetTaskDuration` API call to query execution time of
    asynchronous tasks
-   Support for 16bit (unsigned short) textures
-   Add static `cpp::Device::current` method as a C++ wrapper equivalent
    to `ospGetCurrentDevice`
-   Generalized `cpp::Device` parameter setting to match other handle
    types
-   Passing `NULL` to `ospRelease` is not reported as error anymore
-   Fix computation of strides for `OSPData`
-   Fix transparency in `scivis` renderer
-   Add missing C++ wrapper for `ospGetVariance`
-   Proper demonstration of `ospGetVariance` in `ospTutorialAsync`
-   Fix handling of `--osp:device-params` to process and set all passed
    arguments first before committing the device, to ensure it is
    committed in a valid state
-   Object factory functions are now registered during module
    initialization via the appropriate `registerType` function
-   MPI module: Use flush bcasts to allow us to use non-owning views for
    data transfer. Note that shared `ospData` with strides is currently
    transmitted as whole
-   Fix issue with OSPRay ignoring tasking system thread count settings
-   Fix issue where OSPRay always loaded the ISPC module, even if not
    required
-   Fixes for MPI module
    - Fix member variable type for bcast
    - Fix incorrect data size computation in `offload` device
    - Fix large data chunking support for MPI Bcast
-   OSPRay now requires minimum Open VKL v0.9.0

### Changes in v2.0.1:

-   Fix bug where Embree user-defined geometries were not indexed
    correctly in the scene, which now requires Embree v3.8.0+
-   Fix crash when the path tracer encounters geometric models that do
    not have a material
-   Fix crash when some path tracer materials generated `NULL` bsdfs
-   Fix bug where `ospGetBounds` returned incorrect values
-   Fix missing symbol in denoiser module
-   Fix missing symbol exports on Windows for all OSPRay built modules
-   Add the option to specify a single color for geometric models
-   The `scivis` renderer now respects the opacity component of `color`
    on geometric models
-   Fix various inconsistent handling of framebuffer alpha between
    renderers
-   `ospGetCurrentDevice` now increments the ref count of the returned
    `OSPDevice` handle, so applications will need to release the handle
    when finished by using `ospDeviceRelease` accordingly
-   Added denoiser to `ospExamples` app
-   Added `module_mpi` to superbuild (disabled by default)
-   The superbuild now will emit a CMake error when using any 32-bit
    CMake generator, as 32-bit builds are not supported

### Changes in v2.0.0:

-   New major revision of OSPRay brings API breaking improvements over
    v1.x. See [doc/ospray2_porting_guide.md] for a deeper description of
    migrating from v1.x to v2.0 and the latest
    [API documentation](README.md#ospray-api)
    -   `ospRenderFrame` now takes all participating objects as
        function parameters instead of setting some as renderer params
    -   `ospRenderFrame` is now asynchronous, where the task is managed
        through a returned `OSPFuture` handle
    -   The hierarchy of objects in a scene are now more granular to
        aid in scene construction flexibility and reduce potential
        object duplication
    -   Type-specific parameter setting functions have been consolidated
        into a single `ospSetParam` API call
    -   C++ wrappers found in `ospray_cpp.h` now automatically track
        handle lifetimes, therefore applications using them do not need
        to use `ospRelease` (or the new `ospRetain`) with them: see
        usage example in `apps/tutorials/ospTutorial.cpp`
    -   Unused parameters are reported as status messages when
        `logLevel` is at least `warning` (most easily set by enabling
        OSPRay debug on initialization)
-   New utility library which adds functions to help with new API
    migration and reduction of boilerplate code
    -   Use `ospray_util.h` to access these additional functions
    -   All utility functions are implemented in terms of the core API
        found in `ospray.h`, therefore they are compatible with any
        device backend
-   Introduction of new IntelÂ® Open Volume Kernel Library (Open VKL)
    for greatly enhanced volume sampling and rendering features and
    performance
-   Added direct support for IntelÂ® Open Image Denoise as an optional
    module, which adds a `denoiser` type to `ospNewImageOperation`
-   OSPRay now requires minimum Embree v3.7.0
-   New CMake superbuild available to build both OSPRay's dependencies
    and OSPRay itself
    -   Found in `scripts/superbuild`
    -   See documentation for more details and example usage
-   The `ospcommon` library now lives as a stand alone repository and
    is required to build OSPRay
-   The MPI module is now a separate repository, which also contains all
    MPI distributed rendering documentation
-   Log levels are now controled with enums and named strings (where
    applicable)
    -   A new flag was also introduced which turns all OSP_LOG_WARNING
        messages into errors, which are submitted to the error callback
        instead of the message callback
    -   Any unused parameters an object ignores now emit a warning
        message
-   New support for volumes in the `pathtracer`
    -   Several parameters are available for performance/quality
        trade-offs for both photorealistic and scientific visualization
        use cases
-   Simplification of the SciVis renderer
    -   Fixed AO lighting and simple ray marched volume rendering for
        ease of use and performance
-   Overlapping volumes are now supported in both the `pathtracer` and
    `scivis` renderers
-   New API call for querying the bounds of objects (`OSPWorld`,
    `OSPInstance`, and `OSPGroup`)
-   Lights now exist as a parameter to the world instead of the renderer
-   Removal of `slices` geometry. Instead, any geometry with volume
    texture can be used for slicing
-   Introduction of new `boxes` geometry type
-   Expansion of information returned by `ospPick`
-   Addition of API to query version information at runtime
-   Curves now supports both, per vertex varying radii as in `vec4f[]
    vertex.position_radius` and constant radius for the geometry with
    `float radius`. It uses `OSP_ROUND` type and `OSP_LINEAR` basis by
    default to create the connected segments of constant radius. For per
    vertex varying radii curves it uses Embree curves.
-   Add new Embree curve type `OSP_CATMULL_ROM` for curves
-   Minimum required Embree version is now 3.7.0
-   Removal of `cylinders` and `streamlines` geometry, use `curves`
    instead
-   Triangle mesh and Quad mesh are superseded by the `mesh` geometry
-   Applications need to use the various error reporting methods to
    check whether the creation (via `ospNew...`) of objects failed; a
    returned `NULL` is not a special handle anymore to signify an error
-   Changed module init methods to facilitate version checking:
    `extern "C" OSPError ospray_module_init_<name>(int16_t versionMajor, int16_t versionMinor, int16_t versionPatch)`
-   The `map_backplate` texture is supported in all renderers and does
    not hide lights in infinity (like the HDRI light) anymore;
    explicitly make lights in`visible` if this is needed
-   Changed the computation of variance for adaptive accumulation to be
    independent of `TILE_SIZE`, thus `varianceThreshold` needs to be
    adapted if using a different `TILE_SIZE` than default 64
-   `OSPGeometricModel` now has the option to index a renderer-global
    material list that lives on the renderer, allowing scenes to avoid
    renderer-specific materials
-   Object type names and parameters all now follow the camel-case
    convention
-   New `ospExamples` app which consolidates previous interactive apps
    into one
-   New `ospBenchmark` app which implements a runnable benchmark suite
-   Known issues:
    -   ISPC v1.11.0 and Embree v3.6.0 are both incompatible with OSPRay
        and should be avoided (OSPRay should catch this during CMake
        configure)
-   MPI module
    -   The MPI module is now provided separately from the main OSPRay
        repository
    -   Users can now extend OSPRay with custom distributed renderers
        and compositing operations, by extending
        `ospray::mpi::DistributedRenderer` and the
        `ospray::mpi::TileOperation`, respectively. See the
        `ospray::mpi::DistributedRaycastRenderer` for an example to
        start from.
    -   The MPI Offload device can now communicate over sockets, allowing
        for remote rendering on clusters in the listen/connect mode
    -   Data and commands are now sent asynchronously to the MPI workers
        in the Offload device, overlapping better with application work.
        The number of data copies performed has also been significantly
        reduced, and should improve load times
    -   The MPI Distributed device will now infer the rank's local data
        bounds based on the volumes and geometry specified if no bounding
        boxes are specified
    -   When specifying custom bounds on each rank IDs are no longer
        required, and ranks sharing data will be determined by finding
        any specifying the same bounding boxes. This will also be done
        if no bounds are specified, allowing automatic image and hybrid
        parallel rendering.
    -   The MPI Distributed device can now be used for image-parallel
        rendering (e.g., same as offload), where now each application
        can load data in parallel. See the
        `ospMPIDistributedTutorialReplicatedData` for an example.

### Changes in v1.8.5:

-   Fix float precision cornercase (`NaN`s) in sphere light sampling
-   Fix CMake bug that assumed `.git` was a directory, which is not true
    when using OSPRay as a git submodule
-   Fix CMake warning
-   Fix `DLL_EXPORT` issue with `ospray_testing` helper library on
    Windows

### Changes in v1.8.4:

-   Add location of `libospray` to paths searched to find modules

### Changes in v1.8.3:

-   Fix bug where parameters set by `ospSet1b()` were being ignored
-   Fix bug in box intersection tests possibly creating `NaN`s
-   Fix issue with client applications calling `find_package(ospray)`
    more than once
-   Fix bug in cylinder intersection when ray and cylinder are
    perpendicular
-   Fix rare crash in path tracer / MultiBSDF

### Changes in v1.8.2:

-   CMake bug fix where external users of OSPRay needed CMake newer than
    version 3.1
-   Fix incorrect propagation of tasking system flags from an OSPRay
    install
-   Fix inconsistency between supported environment variables and
    command line parameters passed to `ospInit()`
    -   Missing variables were `OSPRAY_LOAD_MODULES` and
        `OSPRAY_DEFAULT_DEVICE`

### Changes in v1.8.1:

-   CMake bug fix to remove full paths to dependencies in packages

### Changes in v1.8.0:

-   This will be the last minor revision of OSPRay. Future development
    effort in the `devel` branch will be dedicated to v2.0 API changes
    and may break existing v1.x applications.
    -   This will also be the last version of OSPRay to include
        `ospray_sg` and the Example Viewer. Users which depend on these
        should instead use the separate OSPRay Studio project, where
        `ospray_sg` will be migrated.
    -   We will continue to support patch releases of v1.8.x in case of
        any reported bugs
-   Refactored CMake to use newer CMake concepts
    -   All targets are now exported in OSPRay installs and can be
        consumed by client projects with associated includes, libraries,
        and definitions
    -   OSPRay now requires CMake v3.1 to build
    -   See documentation for more details
-   Added new minimal tutorial apps to replace the more complex Example
    Viewer
-   Added new "`subdivision`" geometry type to support subdivision
    surfaces
-   Added support for texture formats `L8`, `LA8` (gamma-encoded
    luminance), and `RA8` (linear two component). Note that the enum
    `OSP_TEXTURE_FORMAT_INVALID` changed its value, thus recompilation
    may be necessary.
-   Automatic epsilon handling, which removes the "`epsilon`" parameter
    on all renderers
-   Normals in framebuffer channel `OSP_FB_NORMAL` are now in
    world-space
-   Added support for IntelÂ® Open Image Denoise to the Example Viewer
    -   This same integration will soon be ported to OSPRay Studio
-   Fixed artifacts for scaled instances of spheres, cylinders and
    streamlines
-   Improvements to precision of intersections with cylinders and
    streamlines
-   Fixed Quadlight: the emitting side is now indeed in direction
    `edge1`Ã`edge2`

### Changes in v1.7.3:

-   Make sure a "`default`" device can always be created
-   Fixed `ospNewTexture2D` (completely implementing old behavior)
-   Cleanup any shared object handles from the OS created from
    `ospLoadModule()`

### Changes in v1.7.2:

-   Fixed issue in `mpi_offload` device where `ospRelease` would
    sometimes not correctly free objects
-   Fixed issue in `ospray_sg` where structured volumes would not
    properly release the underlying OSPRay object handles

### Changes in v1.7.1:

-   Fixed issue where the `Principled` material would sometimes show up
    incorrectly as black
-   Fixed issue where some headers were missing from install packages

### Changes in v1.7.0:

-   Generalized texture interface to support more than classic 2D image
    textures, thus `OSPTexture2D` and `ospNewTexture2D` are now
    deprecated, use the new API call `ospNewTexture("texture2d")`
    instead
    -   Added new `volume` texture type to visualize volume data on
        arbitrary geometry placed inside the volume
-   Added new framebuffer channels `OSP_FB_NORMAL` and `OSP_FB_ALBEDO`
-   Applications can get information about the progress of rendering the
    current frame, and optionally cancel it, by registering a callback
    function via `ospSetProgressFunc()`
-   Lights are not tied to the renderer type, so a new function
    `ospNewLight3()` was introduced to implement this. Please convert
    all uses of `ospNewLight()` and/or `ospNewLight2()` to
    `ospNewLight3()`
-   Added sheenTint parameter to Principled material
-   Added baseNormal parameter to Principled material
-   Added low-discrepancy sampling to path tracer
-   The `spp` parameter on the renderer no longer supports values less
    than 1, instead applications should render to a separate, lower
    resolution framebuffer during interaction to achieve the same
    behavior

### Changes in v1.6.1:

-   Many bug fixes
    -   Quad mesh interpolation and sampling
    -   Normal mapping in path tracer materials
    -   Memory corruption with partly emitting mesh lights
    -   Logic for setting thread affinity

### Changes in v1.6.0:

-   Updated ispc device to use Embree3 (minimum required Embree
    version is 3.1)
-   Added new `ospShutdown()` API function to aid in correctness and
    determinism of OSPRay API cleanup
-   Added "`Principled`" and "`CarPaint"` materials to the path tracer
-   Improved flexibility of the tone mapper
-   Improvements to unstructured volume
    -   Support for wedges (in addition to tets and hexes)
    -   Support for implicit isosurface geometry
    -   Support for cell-centered data (as an alternative to per-vertex
        data)
    -   Added an option to precompute normals, providing a
        memory/performance trade-off for applications
-   Implemented "`quads`" geometry type to handle quads directly

### Changes in v1.5.0:

-   Unstructured tetrahedral volume now generalized to also support
    hexahedral data, now called `unstructured_volume`

-   New MPI distributed device to support MPI distributed applications
    using OSPRay collectively for "in-situ" rendering (currently in
    "alpha")

    -   Currently only supports `raycast` renderer, other renderers will
        be supported in the future
    -   All API calls are expected to be exactly replicated (object
        instances and parameters) except scene data (geometries and
        volumes)
    -   The original MPI device is now called the `mpi_offload` device
        to differentiate between the two implementations
-   Support of IntelÂ® AVX-512 for next generation IntelÂ® XeonÂ® processor
    (codename Skylake), thus new minimum ISPC version is 1.9.1
-   Thread affinity of OSPRay's tasking system can now be controlled via
    either device parameter `setAffinity`, or command line parameter
    `osp:setaffinity`, or environment variable `OSPRAY_SET_AFFINITY`
-   Changed behavior of the background color in the SciVis renderer:
    `bgColor` now includes alpha and is always blended (no
    `backgroundEnabled` anymore). To disable the background do not set
    `bgColor`, or set it to transparent black (0, 0, 0, 0)
-   Geometries "`spheres`" and "`cylinders`" now support texture
    coordinates
-   The GLUT- and Qt-based demo viewer applications have been replaced
    by an example viewer with minimal dependencies
    -   Building the sample applications now requires GCC 4.9
        (previously 4.8) for features used in the C++ standard library;
        OSPRay itself can still be built with GCC 4.8
    -   The new example viewer based on `ospray::sg` (called
        `ospExampleViewerSg`) is the single application we are
        consolidating to, `ospExampleViewer` will remain only as a
        deprecated viewer for compatibility with the old `ospGlutViewer`
        application
-   Deprecated `ospCreateDevice()`; use `ospNewDevice()` instead
-   Improved error handling

        (`ospDeviceGetLastErrorCode()` and `ospDeviceGetLastErrorMsg()`)
        or to register an error callback with `ospDeviceSetErrorFunc()`
    -   Fixed bug where exceptions could leak to C applications

-   Added support for volumes with voxelType `short` (16-bit signed
    integers). Applications need to recompile, because `OSPDataType` has
    been re-enumerated
-   Removed SciVis renderer parameter `aoWeight`, the intensity (and now
    color as well) of AO is controlled via "`ambient`" lights. If
    `aoSamples` is zero (the default) then ambient lights cause ambient
    illumination (without occlusion)
-   New SciVis renderer parameter `aoTransparencyEnabled`, controlling
    whether object transparency is respected when computing ambient
    occlusion (disabled by default, as it is considerable slower)
-   Implement normal mapping for SciVis renderer
-   Support of emissive (and illuminating) geometries in the path tracer
    via new material "`Luminous`"

        callback for handling message outputs from OSPRay
    -   Added ability to remove user set parameter values with new
        `ospRemoveParam()` API function
    -   The MPI device is now provided via a module, removing the need
        for having separately compiled versions of OSPRay with and
        without MPI
    -   OSPRay build dependencies now only get installed if
        `OSPRAY_INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES` CMake variable is enabled

        `imageStart`/`imageEnd` supported by all cameras
-   This will be our last release supporting the first generation Intel
    Xeon Phi coprocessor (codename Knights Corner)
    -   Future major and minor releases will be upgraded to the latest
        version of Embree, which no longer supports Knights Corner
    -   Depending on user feedback, patch releases are still made to
        fix bugs

    -   Tested with GCC v5.3.1 and Clang v3.8
    -   Sample applications and modules have not been fixed yet, thus
        applications which build OSPRay as a CMake subproject should
        disable them with `-DOSPRAY_ENABLE_APPS=OFF` and
        `-DOSPRAY_ENABLE_MODULES=OFF`

            calling `find_package(ospray)`
    -   New OSPRay C++ wrapper classes
        -   These act as a thin layer on top of OSPRay object handles,
            where multiple wrappers will share the same underlying
            handle when assigned, copied, or moved
        -   New OSPRay objects are only created when a class instance is
            explicitly constructed
        -   C++ users are encouraged to use these over the `ospray.h`
            API

        progressive refinement concentrates on regions of the image with
        a variance higher than this threshold
-   Added support for volumes with voxelType `ushort` (16-bit unsigned
    integers)
-   `OSPTexture2D` now supports sRGB formats -- actually most images are
    stored in sRGB. As a consequence the API call `ospNewTexture2D()`
    needed to change to accept the new `OSPTextureFormat` parameter
-   Similarly, OSPRay's framebuffer types now also distinguishes between
    linear and sRGB 8-bit formats. The new types are `OSP_FB_NONE`,
    `OSP_FB_RGBA8`, `OSP_FB_SRGBA`, and `OSP_FB_RGBA32F`
-   Changed "scivis" renderer parameter defaults

    -   Volumes are rendered in the same way the "dvr" volume renderer
        renders them
    -   Ambient occlusion works with implicit isosurfaces, with a known
        visual quality/performance trade-off
