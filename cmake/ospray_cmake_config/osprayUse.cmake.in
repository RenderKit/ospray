# NOTE(jda) - Add CMake commands which will be invoked when find_package(ospray)
#             is called by client applications. For example, it may be useful
#             to automatically have an add_definitions(...) call for clients
#             which need certain preprocessor definitions based on how ospray
#             was built.
