OSPRay
======

This is release v2.5.0 of Intel® OSPRay. For changes and new features
see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md). Visit http://www.ospray.org for more
information.

OSPRay Overview
===============

Intel OSPRay is an **o**pen source, **s**calable, and **p**ortable
**ray** tracing engine for high-performance, high-fidelity visualization
on Intel Architecture CPUs. OSPRay is part of the [Intel oneAPI
Rendering Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/rendering-framework)
and is released under the permissive [Apache 2.0
license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

The purpose of OSPRay is to provide an open, powerful, and easy-to-use
rendering library that allows one to easily build applications that use
ray tracing based rendering for interactive applications (including both
surface- and volume-based visualizations). OSPRay is completely
CPU-based, and runs on anything from laptops, to workstations, to
compute nodes in HPC systems.

OSPRay internally builds on top of [Intel
Embree](https://www.embree.org/) and [ISPC (Intel SPMD Program
Compiler)](https://ispc.github.io/), and fully exploits modern
instruction sets like Intel SSE4, AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512 to achieve high
rendering performance, thus a CPU with support for at least SSE4.1 is
required to run OSPRay.

Building and Finding OSPRay
===========================

The latest OSPRay sources are always available at the [OSPRay GitHub
repository](http://github.com/ospray/ospray). The default `master`
branch should always point to the latest bugfix release.

Prerequisites
-------------

OSPRay currently supports Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. In addition,
before you can build OSPRay you need the following prerequisites:

-   You can clone the latest OSPRay sources via:

    ``` {.sh}
    git clone https://github.com/ospray/ospray.git
    ```

-   To build OSPRay you need [CMake](http://www.cmake.org), any form of
    C++11 compiler (we recommend using GCC, but also support Clang,
    MSVC, and [Intel® C++ Compiler
    (icc)](https://software.intel.com/en-us/c-compilers)), and standard
    Linux development tools. To build the interactive tutorials, you
    should also have some version of OpenGL and GLFW.

-   Additionally you require a copy of the [Intel® SPMD Program Compiler
    (ISPC)](http://ispc.github.io), version 1.14.1 or later. Please
    obtain a release of ISPC from the [ISPC downloads
    page](https://ispc.github.io/downloads.html). The build system looks
    for ISPC in the `PATH` and in the directory right “next to” the
    checked-out OSPRay sources.[^1] Alternatively set the CMake variable
    `ISPC_EXECUTABLE` to the location of the ISPC compiler.

-   OSPRay builds on top of the [Intel oneAPI Rendering Toolkit common
    library (rkcommon)](https://www.github.com/ospray/rkcommon). The
    library provides abstractions for tasking, aligned memory
    allocation, vector math types, among others. For users who also need
    to build rkcommon, we recommend the default the Intel [Threading
    Building Blocks (TBB)](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/) as
    tasking system for performance and flexibility reasons.
    Alternatively you can set CMake variable `RKCOMMON_TASKING_SYSTEM`
    to `OpenMP` or `Internal`.

-   OSPRay also heavily uses Intel [Embree](https://www.embree.org/),
    installing version 3.12.0 or newer is required. If Embree is not
    found by CMake its location can be hinted with the variable
    `embree_DIR`.

-   OSPRay also heavily uses Intel [Open VKL](https://www.openvkl.org/),
    installing version 0.12.0 or newer is required. If Open VKL is not
    found by CMake its location can be hinted with the variable
    `openvkl_DIR`.

-   OSPRay also provides an optional module implementing the `denosier`
    image operation, which is enabled by `OSPRAY_MODULE_DENOISER`. This
    module requires Intel [Open Image
    Denoise](https://openimagedenoise.github.io/) in version 1.2.3 or
    newer. You may need to hint the location of the library with the
    CMake variable `OpenImageDenoise_DIR`.

Depending on your Linux distribution you can install these dependencies
using `yum` or `apt-get`. Some of these packages might already be
installed or might have slightly different names.

Type the following to install the dependencies using `yum`:

``` {.sh}
sudo yum install cmake.x86_64
sudo yum install tbb.x86_64 tbb-devel.x86_64
```

Type the following to install the dependencies using `apt-get`:

``` {.sh}
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui
sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev
```

Under Mac OS X these dependencies can be installed using
[MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/):

``` {.sh}
sudo port install cmake tbb
```

Under Windows please directly use the appropriate installers for
[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/),
[TBB](https://github.com/01org/tbb/releases),
[ISPC](https://ispc.github.io/downloads.html) (for your Visual Studio
version) and [Embree](https://github.com/embree/embree/releases/).

CMake Superbuild
----------------

For convenience, OSPRay provides a CMake Superbuild script which will
pull down OSPRay’s dependencies and build OSPRay itself. By default, the
result is an install directory, with each dependency in its own
directory.

Run with:

``` {.sh}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake [<OSPRAY_SOURCE_LOC>/scripts/superbuild]
cmake --build .
```

On Windows make sure to select the non-default 64bit generator, e.g.

``` {.sh}
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" [<OSPRAY_SOURCE_LOC>/scripts/superbuild]
```

The resulting `install` directory (or the one set with
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`) will have everything in it, with one
subdirectory per dependency.

CMake options to note (all have sensible defaults):

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
:   will be the root directory where everything gets installed.

BUILD_JOBS
:   sets the number given to `make -j` for parallel builds.

INSTALL_IN_SEPARATE_DIRECTORIES
:   toggles installation of all libraries in separate or the same
    directory.

BUILD_EMBREE_FROM_SOURCE
:   set to OFF will download a pre-built version of Embree.

BUILD_OIDN_FROM_SOURCE
:   set to OFF will download a pre-built version of Open Image Denoise.

BUILD_OIDN_VERSION
:   determines which version of Open Image Denoise to pull down.

BUILD_OSPRAY_MODULE_MPI
:   set to ON to build OSPRay’s MPI module for data-replicated and
    distributed parallel rendering on multiple nodes.

For the full set of options, run:

``` {.sh}
ccmake [<OSPRAY_SOURCE_LOC>/scripts/superbuild]
```

or

``` {.sh}
cmake-gui [<OSPRAY_SOURCE_LOC>/scripts/superbuild]
```

Standard CMake build
--------------------

### Compiling OSPRay on Linux and Mac OS X

Assuming the above requisites are all fulfilled, building OSPRay through
CMake is easy:

-   Create a build directory, and go into it

    ``` {.sh}
    mkdir ospray/build
    cd ospray/build
    ```

    (We do recommend having separate build directories for different
    configurations such as release, debug, etc.).

-   The compiler CMake will use will default to whatever the `CC` and
    `CXX` environment variables point to. Should you want to specify a
    different compiler, run cmake manually while specifying the desired
    compiler. The default compiler on most linux machines is `gcc`, but
    it can be pointed to `clang` instead by executing the following:

    ``` {.sh}
    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang ..
    ```

    CMake will now use Clang instead of GCC. If you are ok with using
    the default compiler on your system, then simply skip this step.
    Note that the compiler variables cannot be changed after the first
    `cmake` or `ccmake` run.

-   Open the CMake configuration dialog

    ``` {.sh}
    ccmake ..
    ```

-   Make sure to properly set build mode and enable the components you
    need, etc.; then type ’c’onfigure and ’g’enerate. When back on the
    command prompt, build it using

    ``` {.sh}
    make
    ```

-   You should now have `libospray.[so,dylib]` as well as a set of
    [example applications](#tutorials).

### Compiling OSPRay on Windows

On Windows using the CMake GUI (`cmake-gui.exe`) is the most convenient
way to configure OSPRay and to create the Visual Studio solution files:

-   Browse to the OSPRay sources and specify a build directory (if it
    does not exist yet CMake will create it).

-   Click “Configure” and select as generator the Visual Studio version
    you have (OSPRay needs Visual Studio 15 2017 or newer), for Win64
    (32 bit builds are not supported by OSPRay), e.g., “Visual Studio 15
    2017 Win64”.

-   If the configuration fails because some dependencies could not be
    found then follow the instructions given in the error message, e.g.,
    set the variable `embree_DIR` to the folder where Embree was
    installed and `openvkl_DIR` to where Open VKL was installed.

-   Optionally change the default build options, and then click
    “Generate” to create the solution and project files in the build
    directory.

-   Open the generated `OSPRay.sln` in Visual Studio, select the build
    configuration and compile the project.

Alternatively, OSPRay can also be built without any GUI, entirely on the
console. In the Visual Studio command prompt type:

``` {.sh}
cd path\to\ospray
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" [-D VARIABLE=value] ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

Use `-D` to set variables for CMake, e.g., the path to Embree with
“`-D embree_DIR=\path\to\embree`”.

You can also build only some projects with the `--target` switch.
Additional parameters after “`--`” will be passed to `msbuild`. For
example, to build in parallel only the OSPRay library without the
example applications use

``` {.sh}
cmake --build . --config Release --target ospray -- /m
```

Finding an OSPRay Install with CMake
------------------------------------

Client applications using OSPRay can find it with CMake’s
`find_package()` command. For example,

``` {.sh}
find_package(ospray 2.0.0 REQUIRED)
```

finds OSPRay via OSPRay’s configuration file `osprayConfig.cmake`[^2].
Once found, the following is all that is required to use OSPRay:

``` {.sh}
target_link_libraries(${client_target} ospray::ospray)
```

This will automatically propagate all required include paths, linked
libraries, and compiler definitions to the client CMake target (either
an executable or library).

Advanced users may want to link to additional targets which are exported
in OSPRay’s CMake config, which includes all installed modules. All
targets built with OSPRay are exported in the `ospray::` namespace,
therefore all targets locally used in the OSPRay source tree can be
accessed from an install. For example, `ospray_module_ispc` can be
consumed directly via the `ospray::ospray_module_ispc` target. All
targets have their libraries, includes, and definitions attached to them
for public consumption (please [report
bugs](#ospray-support-and-contact) if this is broken!).

Documentation
=============

The following [API
documentation](http://www.sdvis.org/ospray/download/OSPRay_readme.pdf "OSPRay Documentation")
of OSPRay can also be found as a [pdf
document](http://www.sdvis.org/ospray/download/OSPRay_readme.pdf "OSPRay Documentation").

For a deeper explanation of the concepts, design, features and
performance of OSPRay also have a look at the IEEE Vis 2016 paper
“[OSPRay – A CPU Ray Tracing Framework for Scientific
Visualization](http://www.sdvis.org/ospray/download/talks/IEEEVis2016_OSPRay_paper.pdf)”
(49MB, or get the [smaller
version](http://www.sdvis.org/ospray/download/talks/IEEEVis2016_OSPRay_paper_small.pdf)

talk](http://www.sdvis.org/ospray/download/talks/IEEEVis2016_OSPRay_talk.pdf)
(5.2MB) are also available.

OSPRay API
==========

To access the OSPRay API you first need to include the OSPRay header

``` {.cpp}
#include "ospray/ospray.h"
```

where the API is compatible with C99 and C++.

Initialization and Shutdown
---------------------------

To use the API, OSPRay must be initialized with a “device”. A device is
the object which implements the API. Creating and initializing a device
can be done in either of two ways: command line arguments using
`ospInit` or manually instantiating a device and setting parameters on
it.

### Command Line Arguments

The first is to do so by giving OSPRay the command line from `main()` by
calling

``` {.cpp}
OSPError ospInit(int *argc, const char **argv);
```

OSPRay parses (and removes) its known command line parameters from your
application’s `main` function. For an example see the
[tutorial](#osptutorial). For possible error codes see section [Error
Handling and Status Messages](#error-handling-and-status-messages). It
is important to note that the arguments passed to `ospInit()` are
processed in order they are listed. The following parameters (which are
prefixed by convention with “`--osp:`”) are understood:

| Parameter                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|:--------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--osp:debug`                               | enables various extra checks and debug output, and disables multi-threading                                                                                                                                                  |
| `--osp:num-threads=<n>`                     | use `n` threads instead of per default using all detected hardware threads                                                                                                                                                   |
| `--osp:log-level=<str>`                     | set logging level; valid values (in order of severity) are `none`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, and `debug`                                                                                                                   |
| `--osp:warn-as-error`                       | send `warning` and `error` messages through the error callback, otherwise send `warning` messages through the message callback; must have sufficient `logLevel` to enable warnings                                           |
| `--osp:verbose`                             | shortcut for `--osp:log-level=info` and enable debug output on `cout`, error output on `cerr`                                                                                                                                |
| `--osp:vv`                                  | shortcut for `--osp:log-level=debug` and enable debug output on `cout`, error output on `cerr`                                                                                                                               |
| `--osp:load-modules=<name>[,...]`           | load one or more modules during initialization; equivalent to calling `ospLoadModule(name)`                                                                                                                                  |
| `--osp:log-output=<dst>`                    | convenience for setting where status messages go; valid values for `dst` are `cerr` and `cout`                                                                                                                               |
| `--osp:error-output=<dst>`                  | convenience for setting where error messages go; valid values for `dst` are `cerr` and `cout`                                                                                                                                |
| `--osp:device=<name>`                       | use `name` as the type of device for OSPRay to create; e.g., `--osp:device=cpu` gives you the default `cpu` device; Note if the device to be used is defined in a module, remember to pass `--osp:load-modules=<name>` first |
| `--osp:set-affinity=<n>`                    | if `1`, bind software threads to hardware threads; `0` disables binding; default is `1` on KNL and `0` otherwise                                                                                                             |

: Command line parameters accepted by OSPRay’s `ospInit`.

### Manual Device Instantiation

The second method of initialization is to explicitly create the device
and possibly set parameters. This method looks almost identical to how
other [objects](#objects) are created and used by OSPRay (described in
later sections). The first step is to create the device with

``` {.cpp}
OSPDevice ospNewDevice(const char *type);
```

where the `type` string maps to a specific device implementation. OSPRay
always provides the “`cpu`” device, which maps to a fast, local CPU
implementation. Other devices can also be added through additional
modules, such as distributed MPI device implementations.

Once a device is created, you can call

``` {.cpp}
void ospDeviceSetParam(OSPObject, const char *id, OSPDataType type, const void *mem);
```

to set parameters on the device. The semantics of setting parameters is
exactly the same as `ospSetParam`, which is documented below in the
[parameters](#parameters) section. The following parameters can be set
on all devices:

| Type   | Name        | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
|:-------|:------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| int    | numThreads  | number of threads which OSPRay should use                                                                                                                                          |
| int    | logLevel    | logging level; valid values (in order of severity) are `OSP_LOG_NONE`, `OSP_LOG_ERROR`, `OSP_LOG_WARNING`, `OSP_LOG_INFO`, and `OSP_LOG_DEBUG`                                     |
| string | logOutput   | convenience for setting where status messages go; valid values are `cerr` and `cout`                                                                                               |
| string | errorOutput | convenience for setting where error messages go; valid values are `cerr` and `cout`                                                                                                |
| bool   | debug       | set debug mode; equivalent to `logLevel=debug` and `numThreads=1`                                                                                                                  |
| bool   | warnAsError | send `warning` and `error` messages through the error callback, otherwise send `warning` messages through the message callback; must have sufficient `logLevel` to enable warnings |
| bool   | setAffinity | bind software threads to hardware threads if set to 1; 0 disables binding omitting the parameter will let OSPRay choose                                                            |

: Parameters shared by all devices.

Once parameters are set on the created device, the device must be
committed with

``` {.cpp}
void ospDeviceCommit(OSPDevice);
```

To use the newly committed device, you must call

``` {.cpp}
void ospSetCurrentDevice(OSPDevice);
```

This then sets the given device as the object which will respond to all
other OSPRay API calls.

Device handle lifetimes are managed with two calls, the first which
increments the internal reference count to the given `OSPDevice`

``` {.cpp}
void ospDeviceRetain(OSPDevice)
```

and the second which decrements the reference count

``` {.cpp}
void ospDeviceRelease(OSPDevice)
```

Users can change parameters on the device after initialization (from
either method above), by calling

``` {.cpp}
OSPDevice ospGetCurrentDevice();
```

This function returns the handle to the device currently used to respond
to OSPRay API calls, where users can set/change parameters and recommit
the device. If changes are made to the device that is already set as the
current device, it does not need to be set as current again. Note this
API call will increment the ref count of the returned device handle, so
applications must use `ospDeviceRelease` when finished using the handle
to avoid leaking the underlying device object. If there is no current
device set, this will return an invalid `NULL` handle.

When a device is created, its reference count is initially `1`. When a
device is set as the current device, it internally has its reference
count incremented. Note that `ospDeviceRetain` and `ospDeviceRelease`
should only be used with reference counts that the application tracks:
removing reference held by the current set device should be handled by
`ospShutdown`. Thus, `ospDeviceRelease` should only decrement the
reference counts that come from `ospNewDevice`, `ospGetCurrentDevice`,
and the number of explicit calls to `ospDeviceRetain`.

OSPRay allows applications to query runtime properties of a device in
order to do enhanced validation of what device was loaded at runtime.
The following function can be used to get these device-specific
properties (attributes about the device, not parameter values)

``` {.cpp}
int64_t ospDeviceGetProperty(OSPDevice, OSPDeviceProperty);
```

It returns an integer value of the queried property and the following
properties can be provided as parameter:

``` {.cpp}
OSP_DEVICE_VERSION
OSP_DEVICE_VERSION_MAJOR
OSP_DEVICE_VERSION_MINOR
OSP_DEVICE_VERSION_PATCH
OSP_DEVICE_SO_VERSION
```

### Environment Variables

OSPRay’s generic device parameters can be overridden via environment
variables for easy changes to OSPRay’s behavior without needing to
change the application (variables are prefixed by convention with
“`OSPRAY_`”):

| Variable             | Description                                                                                                |
|:---------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OSPRAY_NUM_THREADS   | equivalent to `--osp:num-threads`                                                                          |

| OSPRAY_LOG_OUTPUT    | equivalent to `--osp:log-output`                                                                           |
| OSPRAY_ERROR_OUTPUT  | equivalent to `--osp:error-output`                                                                         |
| OSPRAY_DEBUG         | equivalent to `--osp:debug`                                                                                |
| OSPRAY_WARN_AS_ERROR | equivalent to `--osp:warn-as-error`                                                                        |
| OSPRAY_SET_AFFINITY  | equivalent to `--osp:set-affinity`                                                                         |
| OSPRAY_LOAD_MODULES  | equivalent to `--osp:load-modules`, can be a comma separated list of modules which will be loaded in order |
| OSPRAY_DEVICE        | equivalent to `--osp:device:`                                                                              |

: Environment variables interpreted by OSPRay.

Note that these environment variables take precedence over values
specified through `ospInit` or manually set device parameters.

### Error Handling and Status Messages

The following errors are currently used by OSPRay:

| Name                  | Description                                             |
|:----------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| OSP_NO_ERROR          | no error occurred                                       |
| OSP_UNKNOWN_ERROR     | an unknown error occurred                               |
| OSP_INVALID_ARGUMENT  | an invalid argument was specified                       |
| OSP_INVALID_OPERATION | the operation is not allowed for the specified object   |
| OSP_OUT_OF_MEMORY     | there is not enough memory to execute the command       |
| OSP_UNSUPPORTED_CPU   | the CPU is not supported (minimum ISA is SSE4.1)        |
| OSP_VERSION_MISMATCH  | a module could not be loaded due to mismatching version |

: Possible error codes, i.e., valid named constants of type `OSPError`.

These error codes are either directly return by some API functions, or
are recorded to be later queried by the application via

``` {.cpp}
OSPError ospDeviceGetLastErrorCode(OSPDevice);
```

A more descriptive error message can be queried by calling

``` {.cpp}
const char* ospDeviceGetLastErrorMsg(OSPDevice);
```

Alternatively, the application can also register a callback function of
type

``` {.cpp}
typedef void (*OSPErrorCallback)(void *userData, OSPError, const char* errorDetails);
```

via

``` {.cpp}
void ospDeviceSetErrorCallback(OSPDevice, OSPErrorCallback, void *userData);
```

to get notified when errors occur.

Applications may be interested in messages which OSPRay emits, whether
for debugging or logging events. Applications can call

``` {.cpp}
void ospDeviceSetStatusCallback(OSPDevice, OSPStatusCallback, void *userData);
```

in order to register a callback function of type

``` {.cpp}
typedef void (*OSPStatusCallback)(void *userData, const char* messageText);
```

which OSPRay will use to emit status messages. By default, OSPRay uses a
callback which does nothing, so any output desired by an application
will require that a callback is provided. Note that callbacks for C++
`std::cout` and `std::cerr` can be alternatively set through `ospInit()`
or the `OSPRAY_LOG_OUTPUT` environment variable.

Applications can clear either callback by passing `NULL` instead of an
actual function pointer.

### Loading OSPRay Extensions at Runtime

OSPRay’s functionality can be extended via plugins (which we call
“modules”), which are implemented in shared libraries. To load module
`name` from `libospray_module_<name>.so` (on Linux and Mac OS X) or
`ospray_module_<name>.dll` (on Windows) use

``` {.cpp}
OSPError ospLoadModule(const char *name);
```

Modules are searched in OS-dependent paths. `ospLoadModule` returns
`OSP_NO_ERROR` if the plugin could be successfully loaded.

### Shutting Down OSPRay

When the application is finished using OSPRay (typically on application
exit), the OSPRay API should be finalized with

``` {.cpp}
void ospShutdown();
```

This API call ensures that the current device is cleaned up
appropriately. Due to static object allocation having non-deterministic
ordering, it is recommended that applications call `ospShutdown()`
before the calling application process terminates.

Objects
-------

All entities of OSPRay (the [renderer](#renderers), [volumes](#volumes),
[geometries](#geometries), [lights](#lights), [cameras](#cameras), …)
are a logical specialization of `OSPObject` and share common mechanism
to deal with parameters and lifetime.

An important aspect of object parameters is that parameters do not get
passed to objects immediately. Instead, parameters are not visible at
all to objects until they get explicitly committed to a given object via
a call to

``` {.cpp}
void ospCommit(OSPObject);
```

at which time all previously additions or changes to parameters are
visible at the same time. If a user wants to change the state of an
existing object (e.g., to change the origin of an already existing
camera) it is perfectly valid to do so, as long as the changed
parameters are recommitted.

The commit semantic allow for batching up multiple small changes, and
specifies exactly when changes to objects will occur. This can impact
performance and consistency for devices crossing a PCI bus or across a
network.

Note that OSPRay uses reference counting to manage the lifetime of all
objects, so one cannot explicitly “delete” any object. Instead, to
indicate that the application does not need and does not access the
given object anymore, call

``` {.cpp}
void ospRelease(OSPObject);
```

This decreases its reference count and if the count reaches `0` the
object will automatically get deleted. Passing `NULL` is not an error.
Note that every handle returned via the API needs to be released when
the object is no longer needed, to avoid memory leaks.

Sometimes applications may want to have more than one reference to an
object, where it is desirable for the application to increment the
reference count of an object. This is done with

``` {.cpp}
void ospRetain(OSPObject);
```

It is important to note that this is only necessary if the application
wants to call `ospRelease` on an object more than once: objects which
contain other objects as parameters internally increment/decrement ref
counts and should not be explicitly done by the application.

### Parameters

Parameters allow to configure the behavior of and to pass data to
objects. However, objects do *not* have an explicit interface for
reasons of high flexibility and a more stable compile-time API. Instead,
parameters are passed separately to objects in an arbitrary order, and
unknown parameters will simply be ignored (though a warning message will
be posted). The following function allows adding various types of
parameters with name `id` to a given object:

``` {.cpp}
void ospSetParam(OSPObject, const char *id, OSPDataType type, const void *mem);
```

The valid parameter names for all `OSPObject`s and what types are valid
are discussed in future sections.

Note that `mem` must always be a pointer *to* the object, otherwise
accidental type casting can occur. This is especially true for pointer
types (`OSP_VOID_PTR` and `OSPObject` handles), as they will implicitly
cast to `void *`, but be incorrectly interpreted. To help with some of
these issues, there also exist variants of `ospSetParam` for specific
types, such as `ospSetInt` and `ospSetVec3f` in the OSPRay utility
library (found in `ospray_util.h`).

Users can also remove parameters that have been explicitly set from
`ospSetParam`. Any parameters which have been removed will go back to
their default value during the next commit unless a new parameter was
set after the parameter was removed. To remove a parameter, use

``` {.cpp}
void ospRemoveParam(OSPObject, const char *id);
```

### Data

OSPRay consumes data arrays from the application using a specific object
type, `OSPData`. There are several components to describing a data
array: element type, 1/2/3 dimensional striding, and whether the array
is shared with the application or copied into opaque, OSPRay-owned
memory.

Shared data arrays require that the application’s array memory outlives
the lifetime of the created `OSPData`, as OSPRay is referring to
application memory. Where this is not preferable, applications use
opaque arrays to allow the `OSPData` to own the lifetime of the array
memory. However, opaque arrays dictate the cost of copying data into it,
which should be kept in mind.

Thus, the most efficient way to specify a data array from the
application is to created a shared data array, which is done with

``` {.cpp}
OSPData ospNewSharedData(const void *sharedData,
    OSPDataType,
    uint64_t numItems1,
    int64_t byteStride1 = 0,
    uint64_t numItems2 = 1,
    int64_t byteStride2 = 0,
    uint64_t numItems3 = 1,
    int64_t byteStride3 = 0);
```

The call returns an `OSPData` handle to the created array. The calling
program guarantees that the `sharedData` pointer will remain valid for
the duration that this data array is being used. The number of elements
`numItems` must be positive (there cannot be an empty data object). The
data is arranged in three dimensions, with specializations to two or one
dimension (if some `numItems` are 1). The distance between consecutive
elements (per dimension) is given in bytes with `byteStride` and can
also be negative. If `byteStride` is zero it will be determined
automatically (e.g., as `sizeof(type)`). Strides do not need to be
ordered, i.e., `byteStride2` can be smaller than `byteStride1`, which is
equivalent to a transpose. However, if the stride should be calculated,
then an ordering in dimensions is assumed to disambiguate, i.e.,
`byteStride1 < byteStride2 < byteStride3`.

The enum type `OSPDataType` describes the different element types that
can be represented in OSPRay; valid constants are listed in the table
below.

: Valid named constants for `OSPDataType`.

If the elements of the array are handles to objects, then their
reference counter is incremented.

An opaque `OSPData` with memory allocated by OSPRay is created with

``` {.cpp}
OSPData ospNewData(OSPDataType,
    uint64_t numItems1,
    uint64_t numItems2 = 1,
    uint64_t numItems3 = 1);
```

To allow for (partial) copies or updates of data arrays use

``` {.cpp}
void ospCopyData(const OSPData source,
    OSPData destination,
    uint64_t destinationIndex1 = 0,
    uint64_t destinationIndex2 = 0,
    uint64_t destinationIndex3 = 0);
```

which will copy the whole[^3] content of the `source` array into
`destination` at the given location `destinationIndex`. The
`OSPDataType`s of the data objects must match. The region to be copied
must be valid inside the destination, i.e., in all dimensions,
`destinationIndex + sourceSize <= destinationSize`. The affected region
`[destinationIndex, destinationIndex + sourceSize)` is marked as dirty,
which may be used by OSPRay to only process or update that sub-region
(e.g., updating an acceleration structure). If the destination array is
shared with OSPData by the application (created with
`ospNewSharedData`), then

-   the source array must be shared as well (thus `ospCopyData` cannot
    be used to read opaque data)
-   if source and destination memory overlaps (aliasing), then behavior
    is undefined
-   except if source and destination regions are identical (including
    matching strides), which can be used by application to mark that
    region as dirty (instead of the whole `OSPData`)

To add a data array as parameter named `id` to another object call also
use

``` {.cpp}
void ospSetObject(OSPObject, const char *id, OSPData);
```

Volumes
-------

Volumes are volumetric data sets with discretely sampled values in 3D
space, typically a 3D scalar field. To create a new volume object of
given type `type` use

``` {.cpp}
OSPVolume ospNewVolume(const char *type);
```

Note that OSPRay’s implementation forwards `type` directly to Open VKL,
allowing new Open VKL volume types to be usable within OSPRay without
the need to change (or even recompile) OSPRay.

### Structured Regular Volume

Structured volumes only need to store the values of the samples, because
their addresses in memory can be easily computed from a 3D position. A
common type of structured volumes are regular grids.

Structured regular volumes are created by passing the type string
“`structuredRegular`” to `ospNewVolume`. Structured volumes are
represented through an `OSPData` 3D array `data` (which may or may not
be shared with the application). The voxel data must be laid out in
xyz-order[^4] and can be compact (best for performance) or can have a
stride between voxels, specified through the `byteStride1` parameter
when creating the `OSPData`. Only 1D strides are supported, additional
strides between scanlines (2D, `byteStride2`) and slices (3D,
`byteStride3`) are not.

The parameters understood by structured volumes are summarized in the
table below.

| Type    | Name           |                       Default | Description                                                                           |
|:--------|:---------------|------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| vec3f   | gridOrigin     |                   $(0, 0, 0)$ | origin of the grid in object-space                                                    |
| vec3f   | gridSpacing    |                   $(1, 1, 1)$ | size of the grid cells in object-space                                                |
| OSPData | data           |                               | the actual voxel 3D [data](#data)                                                     |
| int     | filter         | `OSP_VOLUME_FILTER_TRILINEAR` | filter used for reconstructing the field, also allowed is `OSP_VOLUME_FILTER_NEAREST` |
| int     | gradientFilter |              same as `filter` | filter used during gradient computations                                              |

: Configuration parameters for structured regular volumes.

The size of the volume is inferred from the size of the 3D array `data`,
as is the type of the voxel values (currently supported are:
`OSP_UCHAR`, `OSP_SHORT`, `OSP_USHORT`, `OSP_FLOAT`, and `OSP_DOUBLE`).

### Structured Spherical Volume

Structured spherical volumes are also supported, which are created by
passing a type string of “`structuredSpherical`” to `ospNewVolume`. The
grid dimensions and parameters are defined in terms of radial distance
$r$, inclination angle $\theta$, and azimuthal angle $\phi$, conforming
with the ISO convention for spherical coordinate systems. The coordinate
system and parameters understood by structured spherical volumes are
summarized below.

: Configuration parameters for structured spherical volumes.

The dimensions $(r, \theta, \phi)$ of the volume are inferred from the
size of the 3D array `data`, as is the type of the voxel values
(currently supported are: `OSP_UCHAR`, `OSP_SHORT`, `OSP_USHORT`,
`OSP_FLOAT`, and `OSP_DOUBLE`).

These grid parameters support flexible specification of spheres,
hemispheres, spherical shells, spherical wedges, and so forth. The grid
extents (computed as
`[gridOrigin, gridOrigin + (dimensions - 1) * gridSpacing]`) however
must be constrained such that:

-   $r \geq 0$
-   $0 \leq \theta \leq 180$
-   $0 \leq \phi \leq 360$

### Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) Volume

OSPRay currently supports block-structured (Berger-Colella) AMR volumes.
Volumes are specified as a list of blocks, which exist at levels of
refinement in potentially overlapping regions. Blocks exist in a tree
structure, with coarser refinement level blocks containing finer blocks.
The cell width is equal for all blocks at the same refinement level,
though blocks at a coarser level have a larger cell width than finer
levels.

There can be any number of refinement levels and any number of blocks at
any level of refinement. An AMR volume type is created by passing the
type string “`amr`” to `ospNewVolume`.

Blocks are defined by three parameters: their bounds, the refinement
level in which they reside, and the scalar data contained within each
block.

Note that cell widths are defined *per refinement level*, not per block.

: Configuration parameters for AMR volumes.

Lastly, note that the `gridOrigin` and `gridSpacing` parameters act just
like the structured volume equivalent, but they only modify the root
(coarsest level) of refinement.

In particular, OSPRay’s / Open VKL’s AMR implementation was designed to
cover Berger-Colella \[1\] and Chombo \[2\] AMR data. The `method`
parameter above determines the interpolation method used when sampling
the volume.

OSP_AMR_CURRENT
:   finds the finest refinement level at that cell and interpolates
    through this “current” level

OSP_AMR_FINEST
:   will interpolate at the closest existing cell in the volume-wide
    finest refinement level regardless of the sample cell’s level

OSP_AMR_OCTANT
:   interpolates through all available refinement levels at that cell.
    This method avoids discontinuities at refinement level boundaries at
    the cost of performance

Details and more information can be found in the publication for the
implementation \[3\].

### Unstructured Volume

Unstructured volumes can have their topology and geometry freely
defined. Geometry can be composed of tetrahedral, hexahedral, wedge or
pyramid cell types. The data format used is compatible with VTK and
consists of multiple arrays: vertex positions and values, vertex
indices, cell start indices, cell types, and cell values. An
unstructured volume type is created by passing the type string
“`unstructured`” to `ospNewVolume`.

Sampled cell values can be specified either per-vertex (`vertex.data`)
or per-cell (`cell.data`). If both arrays are set, `cell.data` takes
precedence.

Similar to a mesh, each cell is formed by a group of indices into the
vertices. For each vertex, the corresponding (by array index) data value
will be used for sampling when rendering, if specified. The index order
for a tetrahedron is the same as `VTK_TETRA`: bottom triangle
counterclockwise, then the top vertex.

For hexahedral cells, each hexahedron is formed by a group of eight
indices into the vertices and data values. Vertex ordering is the same
as `VTK_HEXAHEDRON`: four bottom vertices counterclockwise, then top
four counterclockwise.

For wedge cells, each wedge is formed by a group of six indices into the
vertices and data values. Vertex ordering is the same as `VTK_WEDGE`:
three bottom vertices counterclockwise, then top three counterclockwise.

For pyramid cells, each cell is formed by a group of five indices into
the vertices and data values. Vertex ordering is the same as
`VTK_PYRAMID`: four bottom vertices counterclockwise, then the top
vertex.

To maintain VTK data compatibility, the `index` array may be specified
with cell sizes interleaved with vertex indices in the following format:
$n, id_1, ..., id_n, m, id_1, ..., id_m$. This alternative `index` array
layout can be enabled through the `indexPrefixed` flag (in which case,
the `cell.type` parameter must be omitted).

### VDB Volume

VDB volumes implement a data structure that is very similar to the data
structure outlined in Museth \[1\], they are created by passing the type
string “`vdb`” to `ospNewVolume`.

The data structure is a hierarchical regular grid at its core: Nodes are
regular grids, and each grid cell may either store a constant value
(this is called a tile), or child pointers. Nodes in VDB trees are wide:
Nodes on the first level have a resolution of 32^3^ voxels, on the next
level 16^3^, and on the leaf level 8^3^ voxels. All nodes on a given
level have the same resolution. This makes it easy to find the node
containing a coordinate using shift operations (see \[1\]). VDB leaf
nodes are implicit in OSPRay / Open VKL: they are stored as pointers to
user-provided data.

<img src="https://ospray.github.io/images/vdb_structure.svg" width="80.0%" alt="Topology of VDB volumes." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Topology of VDB volumes.</figcaption>
</figure>



VDB volumes interpret input data as constant cells (which are then
potentially filtered). This is in contrast to `structuredRegular`
volumes, which have a vertex-centered interpretation.

The VDB implementation in OSPRay / Open VKL follows the following goals:

-   Efficient data structure traversal on vector architectures.
-   Enable the use of industry-standard `.vdb` files created through the
    OpenVDB library.
-   Compatibility with OpenVDB on a leaf data level, so that `.vdb` file
    may be loaded with minimal overhead.

VDB volumes have the following parameters:

### Particle Volume

Particle volumes consist of a set of points in space. Each point has a
position, a radius, and a weight typically associated with an attribute.
Particle volumes are created by passing the type string “`particle`” to
`ospNewVolume`.

A radial basis function defines the contribution of that particle.
Currently, we use the Gaussian radial basis function
$$\phi(P) = w \exp\left(-\frac{(P - p)^2}{2 r^2}\right),$$ where $P$ is
the particle position, $p$ is the sample position, $r$ is the radius and
$w$ is the weight. At each sample, the scalar field value is then
computed as the sum of each radial basis function $\phi$, for each
particle that overlaps it.

The OSPRay / Open VKL implementation is similar to direct evaluation of
samples in Reda et al. \[2\]. It uses an Embree-built BVH with a custom
traversal, similar to the method in \[1\].

### Transfer Function

Transfer functions map the scalar values of volumes to color and opacity
and thus they can be used to visually emphasize certain features of the
volume. To create a new transfer function of given type `type` use

``` {.cpp}
OSPTransferFunction ospNewTransferFunction(const char *type);
```

The returned handle can be assigned to a volumetric model (described
below) as parameter “`transferFunction`” using `ospSetObject`.

One type of transfer function that is supported by OSPRay is the linear
transfer function, which interpolates between given equidistant colors
and opacities. It is create by passing the string “`piecewiseLinear`” to
`ospNewTransferFunction` and it is controlled by these parameters:

| Type      | Name       | Description                                   |
|:----------|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------|
| vec3f\[\] | color      | [data](#data) array of RGB colors             |
| float\[\] | opacity    | [data](#data) array of opacities              |
| vec2f     | valueRange | domain (scalar range) this function maps from |

: Parameters accepted by the linear transfer function.

The arrays `color` and `opacity` can be of different length.

### VolumetricModels

Volumes in OSPRay are given volume rendering appearance information
through VolumetricModels. This decouples the physical representation of
the volume (and possible acceleration structures it contains) to
rendering-specific parameters (where more than one set may exist
concurrently). To create a volume instance, call

``` {.cpp}
OSPVolumetricModel ospNewVolumetricModel(OSPVolume volume);
```

The passed volume can be `NULL` as long as the volume to be used is
passed as a parameter. If both a volume is specified on object creation
and as a parameter, the parameter value is used. If the parameter value
is later removed, the volume object passed on object creation is again
used.

| Type                | Name             | Default | Description                                                                                                                           |
|:--------------------|:-----------------|--------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OSPTransferFunction | transferFunction |         | [transfer function](#transfer-function) to use                                                                                        |
| float               | densityScale     |     1.0 | makes volumes uniformly thinner or thicker                                                                                            |
| float               | anisotropy       |     0.0 | anisotropy of the (Henyey-Greenstein) phase function in \[-1, 1\] ([path tracer](#path-tracer) only), default to isotropic scattering |
| OSPVolume           | volume           |         | optional [volume](#volumes) object this model references                                                                              |

: Parameters understood by VolumetricModel.

Geometries
----------

Geometries in OSPRay are objects that describe intersectable surfaces.
To create a new geometry object of given type `type` use

``` {.cpp}
OSPGeometry ospNewGeometry(const char *type);
```

Note that in the current implementation geometries are limited to a
maximum of 2^32^ primitives.

### Mesh

A mesh consisting of either triangles or quads is created by calling
`ospNewGeometry` with type string “`mesh`”. Once created, a mesh
recognizes the following parameters:

| Type                    | Name            | Description                                                                         |
|:------------------------|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| vec3f\[\]               | vertex.position | [data](#data) array of vertex positions                                             |
| vec3f\[\]               | vertex.normal   | [data](#data) array of vertex normals                                               |
| vec4f\[\] / vec3f\[\]   | vertex.color    | [data](#data) array of vertex colors (RGBA/RGB)                                     |
| vec2f\[\]               | vertex.texcoord | [data](#data) array of vertex texture coordinates                                   |
| vec3ui\[\] / vec4ui\[\] | index           | [data](#data) array of (either triangle or quad) indices (into the vertex array(s)) |

: Parameters defining a mesh geometry.

The data type of index arrays differentiates between the underlying
geometry, triangles are used for a index with `vec3ui` type and quads
for `vec4ui` type. Quads are internally handled as a pair of two
triangles, thus mixing triangles and quads is supported by encoding some
triangle as a quad with the last two vertex indices being identical
(`w=z`).

The `vertex.position` and `index` arrays are mandatory to create a valid
mesh.

### Subdivision

A mesh consisting of subdivision surfaces, created by specifying a
geometry of type “`subdivision`”. Once created, a subdivision recognizes
the following parameters:

| Type      | Name                | Description                                                                                                           |
|:----------|:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| vec3f\[\] | vertex.position     | [data](#data) array of vertex positions                                                                               |
| vec4f\[\] | vertex.color        | optional [data](#data) array of vertex colors (RGBA)                                                                  |
| vec2f\[\] | vertex.texcoord     | optional [data](#data) array of vertex texture coordinates                                                            |
| float     | level               | global level of tessellation, default 5                                                                               |
| uint\[\]  | index               | [data](#data) array of indices (into the vertex array(s))                                                             |
| float\[\] | index.level         | optional [data](#data) array of per-edge levels of tessellation, overrides global level                               |

| uint\[\]  | vertexCrease.index  | optional [data](#data) array of vertex crease indices                                                                 |

: Parameters defining a Subdivision geometry.

The `vertex` and `index` arrays are mandatory to create a valid
subdivision surface. If no `face` array is present then a pure quad mesh
is assumed (the number of indices must be a multiple of 4). Optionally
supported are edge and vertex creases.

### Spheres

A geometry consisting of individual spheres, each of which can have an
own radius, is created by calling `ospNewGeometry` with type string
“`sphere`”. The spheres will not be tessellated but rendered
procedurally and are thus perfectly round. To allow a variety of sphere
representations in the application this geometry allows a flexible way
of specifying the data of center position and radius within a
[data](#data) array:

| Type      | Name            | Default | Description                                                               |
|:----------|:----------------|--------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| vec3f\[\] | sphere.position |         | [data](#data) array of center positions                                   |
| float\[\] | sphere.radius   |    NULL | optional [data](#data) array of the per-sphere radius                     |
| vec2f\[\] | sphere.texcoord |    NULL | optional [data](#data) array of texture coordinates (constant per sphere) |
| float     | radius          |    0.01 | default radius for all spheres (if `sphere.radius` is not set)            |

: Parameters defining a spheres geometry.

### Curves

A geometry consisting of multiple curves is created by calling
`ospNewGeometry` with type string “`curve`”. The parameters defining

: Parameters defining a curves geometry.

Positions in `vertex.position_radius` parameter supports per-vertex
varying radii with data type `vec4f[]` and instantiate Embree curves
internally for the relevant type/basis mapping.

The following section describes the properties of different curve basis’
and how they use the data provided in data buffers:

OSP_LINEAR
:   The indices point to the first of 2 consecutive control points in
    the vertex buffer. The first control point is the start and the
    second control point the end of the line segment. The curve goes
    through all control points listed in the vertex buffer.

OSP_BEZIER
:   The indices point to the first of 4 consecutive control points in
    the vertex buffer. The first control point represents the start
    point of the curve, and the 4th control point the end point of the
    curve. The Bézier basis is interpolating, thus the curve does go
    exactly through the first and fourth control vertex.

OSP_BSPLINE
:   The indices point to the first of 4 consecutive control points in
    the vertex buffer. This basis is not interpolating, thus the curve
    does in general not go through any of the control points directly.
    Using this basis, 3 control points can be shared for two continuous
    neighboring curve segments, e.g., the curves $(p0, p1, p2, p3)$ and
    $(p1, p2, p3, p4)$ are C1 continuous. This feature make this basis a
    good choice to construct continuous multi-segment curves, as memory
    consumption can be kept minimal.

OSP_HERMITE
:   It is necessary to have both vertex buffer and tangent buffer for
    using this basis. The indices point to the first of 2 consecutive
    points in the vertex buffer, and the first of 2 consecutive tangents
    in the tangent buffer. This basis is interpolating, thus does
    exactly go through the first and second control point, and the first
    order derivative at the begin and end matches exactly the value
    specified in the tangent buffer. When connecting two segments
    continuously, the end point and tangent of the previous segment can
    be shared.

OSP_CATMULL_ROM
:   The indices point to the first of 4 consecutive control points in
    the vertex buffer. If $(p0, p1, p2, p3)$ represent the points then
    this basis goes through $p1$ and $p2$, with tangents as $(p2-p0)/2$
    and $(p3-p1)/2$.

The following section describes the properties of different curve types’
and how they define the geometry of a curve:

OSP_FLAT
:   This type enables faster rendering as the curve is rendered as a
    connected sequence of ray facing quads.

OSP_ROUND
:   This type enables rendering a real geometric surface for the curve
    which allows closeup views. This mode renders a sweep surface by
    sweeping a varying radius circle tangential along the curve.

OSP_RIBBON
:   The type enables normal orientation of the curve and requires a
    normal buffer be specified along with vertex buffer. The curve is
    rendered as a flat band whose center approximately follows the
    provided vertex buffer and whose normal orientation approximately
    follows the provided normal buffer. Not supported for basis
    `OSP_LINEAR`.

OSP_DISJOINT
:   Only supported for basis `OSP_LINEAR`; the segments are open and not
    connected at the joints, i.e., the curve segments are either
    individual cones or cylinders.

### Boxes

OSPRay can directly render axis-aligned bounding boxes without the need
to convert them to quads or triangles. To do so create a boxes geometry
by calling `ospNewGeometry` with type string “`box`”.

| Type      | Name | Description                  |
|:----------|:-----|:-----------------------------|
| box3f\[\] | box  | [data](#data) array of boxes |

: Parameters defining a boxes geometry.

### Planes

OSPRay can directly render planes defined by plane equation coefficients
in its implicit form $ax + by + cz + d = 0$. By default planes are
infinite but their extents can be limited by defining optional bounding
boxes. A planes geometry can be created by calling `ospNewGeometry` with
type string “`plane`”.

| Type      | Name Descript      | ion                                                      |
|:----------|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| vec4f\[\] | plane.coefficients | [data](#data) array of plane coefficients $(a, b, c, d)$ |
| box3f\[\] | plane.bounds       | optional [data](#data) array of bounding boxes           |

: Parameters defining a planes geometry.

### Isosurfaces

OSPRay can directly render multiple isosurfaces of a volume without
first tessellating them. To do so create an isosurfaces geometry by
calling `ospNewGeometry` with type string “`isosurface`”. The appearance
information of the surfaces is set through the Geometric Model.
Per-isosurface colors can be set by passing per-primitive colors to the
Geometric Model, in order of the isosurface array.

| Type      | Name     | Description                                        |
|:----------|:---------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| float     | isovalue | single isovalues                                   |
| float\[\] | isovalue | [data](#data) array of isovalues                   |
| OSPVolume | volume   | handle of the [Volume](#volumes) to be isosurfaced |

: Parameters defining an isosurfaces geometry.

### GeometricModels

Geometries are matched with surface appearance information through
GeometricModels. These take a geometry, which defines the surface
representation, and applies either full-object or per-primitive color
and material information. To create a geometric model, call

``` {.cpp}
OSPGeometricModel ospNewGeometricModel(OSPGeometry geometry);
```

The passed geometry can be `NULL` as long as the geometry to be used is
passed as a parameter. If both a geometry is specified on object
creation and as a parameter, the parameter value is used. If the
parameter value is later removed, the geometry object passed on object
creation is again used.

Color and material are fetched with the primitive ID of the hit (clamped
to the valid range, thus a single color or material is fine), or mapped
first via the `index` array (if present). All parameters are optional,
however, some renderers (notably the [path tracer](#path-tracer))
require a material to be set. Materials are either handles of
`OSPMaterial`, or indices into the `material` array on the
[renderer](#renderers), which allows to build a [world](#world) which
can be used by different types of renderers.

An `invertNormals` flag allows to invert (shading) normal vectors of the
rendered geometry. That is particularly useful for clipping. By changing
normal vectors orientation one can control whether inside or outside of
the clipping geometry is being removed. For example, a clipping geometry
with normals oriented outside clips everything what’s inside.

| Type                         | Name          | Description                                                                                                                                         |

: Parameters understood by GeometricModel.

Lights
------

To create a new light source of given type `type` use

``` {.cpp}
OSPLight ospNewLight(const char *type);
```

All light sources accept the following parameters:

| Type  | Name              | Default | Description                                                                                                                     |
|:------|:------------------|--------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| vec3f | color             |   white | color of the light                                                                                                              |
| float | intensity         |       1 | intensity of the light (a factor)                                                                                               |
| uchar | intensityQuantity |         | `OSPIntensityQuantity` to set the radiative quantity represented by `intensity`. The default value depends on the light source. |
| bool  | visible           |    true | whether the light can be directly seen                                                                                          |

: Parameters accepted by all lights.

In OSPRay the `intensity` parameter of a light source can correspond to
different types of radiative quantities. The type of the value
represented by a light’s `intensity` parameter is set using
`intensityQuantity`, which accepts values from the enum type
`OSPIntensityQuantity`. The supported types of `OSPIntensityQuantity`
differ between the different light sources (see documentation of each
specific light source).

| Name                              | Description                                                                                                            |
|:----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_POWER      | the overall amount of light energy emitted by the light source into the scene, unit is W                               |
| OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_INTENSITY  | the overall amount of light emitted by the light in a given direction, unit is W/sr                                    |
| OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_RADIANCE   | the amount of light emitted by a point on the light source in a given direction, unit is W/sr/m^2^                     |
| OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_IRRADIANCE | the amount of light arriving at a surface point, assuming the light is oriented towards to the surface, unit is W/m^2^ |

: Types of radiative quantities used to interpret a light’s `intensity`
parameter.

The following light types are supported by most OSPRay renderers.

### Directional Light / Distant Light

The distant light (or traditionally the directional light) is thought to
be far away (outside of the scene), thus its light arrives (almost) as
parallel rays. It is created by passing the type string “`distant`” to
`ospNewLight`. The distant light supports
`OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_RADIANCE` and
`OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_IRRADIANCE` (default) as `intensityQuantity`
parameter value. In addition to the [general parameters](#lights)
understood by all lights the distant light supports the following
special parameters:

| Type  | Name            | Description                                  |
|:------|:----------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| vec3f | direction       | main emission direction of the distant light |
| float | angularDiameter | apparent size (angle in degree) of the light |

: Special parameters accepted by the distant light.

Setting the angular diameter to a value greater than zero will result in
soft shadows when the renderer uses stochastic sampling (like the [path
tracer](#path-tracer)). For instance, the apparent size of the sun is
about 0.53°.

### Point Light / Sphere Light

The sphere light (or the special case point light) is a light emitting
uniformly in all directions from the surface toward the outside. It does
not emit any light toward the inside of the sphere. It is created by
passing the type string “`sphere`” to `ospNewLight`. The point light
supports `OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_POWER`,
`OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_INTENSITY` (default) and
`OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_RADIANCE` as `intensityQuantity` parameter
value. In addition to the [general parameters](#lights) understood by
all lights the sphere light supports the following special parameters:

| Type  | Name     | Description                                    |
|:------|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| vec3f | position | the center of the sphere light, in world-space |
| float | radius   | the size of the sphere light                   |

: Special parameters accepted by the sphere light.

Setting the radius to a value greater than zero will result in soft
shadows when the renderer uses stochastic sampling (like the [path
tracer](#path-tracer)).

### Spotlight / Photometric Light

The spotlight is a light emitting into a cone of directions. It is
created by passing the type string “`spot`” to `ospNewLight`. The
spotlight supports `OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_POWER`,
`OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_INTENSITY` (default) and
`OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_RADIANCE` as `intensityQuantity` parameter
value. In addition to the [general parameters](#lights) understood by
all lights the spotlight supports the special parameters listed in the
table.

| Type      | Name                  |     Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |

: Special parameters accepted by the spotlight.

![Angles used by the
spotlight.](https://ospray.github.io/images/spot_light.png)

Setting the radius to a value greater than zero will result in soft
shadows when the renderer uses stochastic sampling (like the [path
tracer](#path-tracer)). Additionally setting the inner radius will
result in a ring instead of a disk emitting the light.

Measured light sources (IES, EULUMDAT, …) are supported by providing an
`intensityDistribution` [data](#data) array to modulate the intensity
per direction. The mapping is using the C-γ coordinate system (see also
below figure): the values of the first (or only) dimension of
`intensityDistribution` are uniformly mapped to γ in \[0–π\]; the first
intensity value to 0, the last value to π, thus at least two values need
to be present. If the array has a second dimension then the intensities
are not rotational symmetric around `direction`, but are accordingly
mapped to the C-halfplanes in \[0–2π\]; the first “row” of values to 0
and 2π, the other rows such that they have uniform distance to its
neighbors. The orientation of the C0-plane is specified via `c0`. A
combination of using an `intensityDistribution` and
`OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_POWER` as `intensityQuantity` is not supported
at the moment.

the spotlight.](https://ospray.github.io/images/spot_coords.png)

### Quad Light

The quad[^5] light is a planar, procedural area light source emitting
uniformly on one side into the half-space. It is created by passing the
type string “`quad`” to `ospNewLight`. The quad light supports
`OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_POWER`, `OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_INTENSITY` and
`OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_RADIANCE` (default) as `intensityQuantity`
parameter. In addition to the [general parameters](#lights) understood
by all lights the quad light supports the following special parameters:

| Type  | Name     | Description                                          |
|:------|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| vec3f | position | world-space position of one vertex of the quad light |
| vec3f | edge1    | vector to one adjacent vertex                        |
| vec3f | edge2    | vector to the other adjacent vertex                  |

: Special parameters accepted by the quad light.

![Defining a quad light which emits toward the
reader.](https://ospray.github.io/images/quad_light.png)

The emission side is determined by the cross product of `edge1`×`edge2`.
Note that only renderers that use stochastic sampling (like the path
tracer) will compute soft shadows from the quad light. Other renderers
will just sample the center of the quad light, which results in hard
shadows.

### HDRI Light

The HDRI light is a textured light source surrounding the scene and
illuminating it from infinity. It is created by passing the type string
“`hdri`” to `ospNewLight`. The HDRI light only accepts
`OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_RADIANCE` as `intensityQuantity` parameter
value. In addition to the [general parameters](#lights) the HDRI light
supports the following special parameters:

| Type       | Name      | Description                                                                                                      |
|:-----------|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| vec3f      | up        | up direction of the light in world-space                                                                         |
| vec3f      | direction | direction to which the center of the texture will be mapped to (analog to [panoramic camera](#panoramic-camera)) |
| OSPTexture | map       | environment map in latitude / longitude format                                                                   |

: Special parameters accepted by the HDRI light.

![Orientation and Mapping of an HDRI
Light.](https://ospray.github.io/images/hdri_light.png)

Note that the [SciVis renderer](#scivis-renderer) only shows the HDRI
light in the background (like an environment map) without computing
illumination of the scene.

### Ambient Light

The ambient light surrounds the scene and illuminates it from infinity
with constant radiance (determined by combining the [parameters `color`
and `intensity`](#lights)). It is created by passing the type string
“`ambient`” to `ospNewLight`. The ambient light supports
`OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_RADIANCE` and
`OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_IRRADIANCE` (default) as `intensityQuantity`
parameter value.

Note that the [SciVis renderer](#scivis-renderer) uses ambient lights to
control the color and intensity of the computed ambient occlusion (AO).

### Sun-Sky Light

The sun-sky light is a combination of a `distant` light for the sun and
a procedural `hdri` light for the sky. It is created by passing the type
string “`sunSky`” to `ospNewLight`. The sun-sky light surrounds the
scene and illuminates it from infinity and can be used for rendering
outdoor scenes. The radiance values are calculated using the
Hošek-Wilkie sky model and solar radiance function. The sun-sky light
only accepts `OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_RADIANCE` as `intensityQuantity`
parameter value. In addition to the [general parameters](#lights) the
following special parameters are supported:

| Type  | Name             |      Default | Description                                                                                          |
|:------|:-----------------|-------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| vec3f | up               |  $(0, 1, 0)$ | zenith of sky in world-space                                                                         |
| vec3f | direction        | $(0, -1, 0)$ | main emission direction of the sun                                                                   |
| float | turbidity        |            3 | atmospheric turbidity due to particles, in \[1–10\]                                                  |
| float | albedo           |          0.3 | ground reflectance, in \[0–1\]                                                                       |
| float | horizonExtension |         0.01 | extend the sky dome by stretching the horizon, fraction of the lower hemisphere to cover, in \[0–1\] |

: Special parameters accepted by the `sunSky` light.

The lowest elevation for the sun is restricted to the horizon.

Note that the [SciVis renderer](#scivis-renderer) only computes
illumination from the sun (yet the sky is still shown in the background,
like an environment map).

### Emissive Objects

The [path tracer](#path-tracer) will consider illumination by
[geometries](#geometries) which have a light emitting material assigned
(for example the [Luminous](#luminous) material).

Scene Hierarchy
---------------

### Groups

Groups in OSPRay represent collections of GeometricModels and
VolumetricModels which share a common local-space coordinate system. To
create a group call

``` {.cpp}
OSPGroup ospNewGroup();
```

Groups take arrays of geometric models, volumetric models and clipping
geometric models, but they are optional. In other words, there is no
need to create empty arrays if there are no geometries or volumes in the
group.

By adding `OSPGeometricModel`s to the `clippingGeometry` array a
clipping geometry feature is enabled. Geometries assigned to this
parameter will be used as clipping geometries. Any supported geometry
can be used for clipping. The only requirement is that it has to
distinctly partition space into clipping and non-clipping one. These
include: spheres, boxes, infinite planes, closed meshes, closed
subdivisions and curves. All geometries and volumes assigned to
`geometry` or `volume` will be clipped. Use of clipping geometry that is
not closed (or infinite) will result in rendering artifacts. User can
decide which part of space is clipped by changing shading normals
orientation with the `invertNormals` flag of the
[GeometricModel](#geometricmodels). When more than single clipping
geometry is defined all clipping areas will be “added” together – an
union of these areas will be applied.

| Type                   | Name             | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------|--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OSPGeometricModel\[\]  | geometry         |    NULL | [data](#data) array of [GeometricModels](#geometricmodels)                                                                                                  |
| OSPVolumetricModel\[\] | volume           |    NULL | [data](#data) array of [VolumetricModels](#volumetricmodels)                                                                                                |
| OSPGeometricModel\[\]  | clippingGeometry |    NULL | [data](#data) array of [GeometricModels](#geometricmodels) used for clipping                                                                                |
| bool                   | dynamicScene     |   false | use RTC_SCENE_DYNAMIC flag (faster BVH build, slower ray traversal), otherwise uses RTC_SCENE_STATIC flag (faster ray traversal, slightly slower BVH build) |
| bool                   | compactMode      |   false | tell Embree to use a more compact BVH in memory by trading ray traversal performance                                                                        |
| bool                   | robustMode       |   false | tell Embree to enable more robust ray intersection code paths (slightly slower)                                                                             |

: Parameters understood by groups.

Note that groups only need to re re-committed if a geometry or volume
changes (surface/scalar field representation). Appearance information on
`OSPGeometricModel` and `OSPVolumetricModel` can be changed freely, as
internal acceleration structures do not need to be reconstructed.

### Instances

Instances in OSPRay represent a single group’s placement into the world
via a transform. To create and instance call

``` {.cpp}
OSPInstance ospNewInstance(OSPGroup);
```

| Type     | Name |  Default | Description                                                   |
|:---------|:-----|---------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| affine3f | xfm  | identity | world-space transform for all attached geometries and volumes |

: Parameters understood by instances.

### World

Worlds are a container of scene data represented by
[instances](#instances). To create an (empty) world call

``` {.cpp}
OSPWorld ospNewWorld();
```

Objects are placed in the world through an array of instances. Similar
to [groups](#groups), the array of instances is optional: there is no
need to create empty arrays if there are no instances (though there will
be nothing to render).

Applications can query the world (axis-aligned) bounding box after the
world has been committed. To get this information, call

``` {.cpp}
OSPBounds ospGetBounds(OSPObject);
```

The result is returned in the provided `OSPBounds`[^6] struct:

``` {.cpp}
typedef struct {
    float lower[3];
    float upper[3];
} OSPBounds;
```

This call can also take `OSPGroup` and `OSPInstance` as well: all other
object types will return an empty bounding box.

Finally, Worlds can be configured with parameters for making various
feature/performance trade-offs (similar to groups).

| Type            | Name         | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
|:----------------|:-------------|--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OSPInstance\[\] | instance     |    NULL | [data](#data) array with handles of the [instances](#instances)                                                                                             |
| OSPLight\[\]    | light        |    NULL | [data](#data) array with handles of the [lights](#lights)                                                                                                   |
| bool            | dynamicScene |   false | use RTC_SCENE_DYNAMIC flag (faster BVH build, slower ray traversal), otherwise uses RTC_SCENE_STATIC flag (faster ray traversal, slightly slower BVH build) |
| bool            | compactMode  |   false | tell Embree to use a more compact BVH in memory by trading ray traversal performance                                                                        |
| bool            | robustMode   |   false | tell Embree to enable more robust ray intersection code paths (slightly slower)                                                                             |

: Parameters understood by worlds.

Renderers
---------

A renderer is the central object for rendering in OSPRay. Different
renderers implement different features and support different materials.
To create a new renderer of given type `type` use

``` {.cpp}
OSPRenderer ospNewRenderer(const char *type);
```

General parameters of all renderers are

| Type                  | Name              |                 Default | Description                                                                                                                                 |
|:----------------------|:------------------|------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| int                   | pixelSamples      |                       1 | samples per pixel                                                                                                                           |
| int                   | maxPathLength     |                      20 | maximum ray recursion depth                                                                                                                 |
| float                 | minContribution   |                   0.001 | sample contributions below this value will be neglected to speedup rendering                                                                |
| float                 | varianceThreshold |                       0 | threshold for adaptive accumulation                                                                                                         |
| float / vec3f / vec4f | backgroundColor   |      black, transparent | background color and alpha (RGBA), if no `map_backplate` is set                                                                             |
| OSPTexture            | map_backplate     |                         | optional [texture](#texture) image used as background (use texture type `texture2d`)                                                        |
| OSPTexture            | map_maxDepth      |                         | optional screen-sized float [texture](#texture) with maximum far distance per pixel (use texture type `texture2d`)                          |
| OSPMaterial\[\]       | material          |                         | optional [data](#data) array of [materials](#materials) which can be indexed by a [GeometricModel](#geometricmodels)’s `material` parameter |
| uchar                 | pixelFilter       | `OSP_PIXELFILTER_GAUSS` | `OSPPixelFilterType` to select the pixel filter used by the renderer for antialiasing. Possible pixel filters are listed below.             |

: Parameters understood by all renderers.

OSPRay’s renderers support a feature called adaptive accumulation, which
accelerates progressive [rendering](#rendering) by stopping the
rendering and refinement of image regions that have an estimated
variance below the `varianceThreshold`. This feature requires a
[framebuffer](#framebuffer) with an `OSP_FB_VARIANCE` channel.

Per default the background of the rendered image will be transparent
black, i.e., the alpha channel holds the opacity of the rendered
objects. This eases transparency-aware blending of the image with an
arbitrary background image by the application. The parameter
`backgroundColor` or `map_backplate` can be used to already blend with a
constant background color or backplate texture, respectively, (and
alpha) during rendering.

OSPRay renderers support depth composition with images of other
renderers, for example to incorporate help geometries of a 3D UI that
were rendered with OpenGL. The screen-sized [texture](#texture)
`map_maxDepth` must have format `OSP_TEXTURE_R32F` and flag
`OSP_TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST`. The fetched values are used to limit the
distance of primary rays, thus objects of other renderers can hide
objects rendered by OSPRay.

OSPRay supports antialiasing in image space by using pixel filters,
which are centered around the center of a pixel. The size $w×w$ of the
filter depends on the selected filter type. The types of supported pixel
filters are defined by the `OSPPixelFilterType` enum and can be set
using the `pixelFilter` parameter.

| Name                            | Description                                                                                                   |
|:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OSP_PIXELFILTER_POINT           | a point filter only samples the center of the pixel, therefore the filter width is $w = 0$                    |
| OSP_PIXELFILTER_BOX             | a uniform box filter with a width of $w = 1$                                                                  |
| OSP_PIXELFILTER_GAUSS           | a truncated, smooth Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of $\sigma = 0.5$ and a filter width of $w = 3$ |
| OSP_PIXELFILTER_MITCHELL        | the Mitchell-Netravali filter with a width of $w = 4$                                                         |
| OSP_PIXELFILTER_BLACKMAN_HARRIS | the Blackman-Harris filter with a width of $w = 3$                                                            |

: Pixel filter types supported by OSPRay for antialiasing in image
space.

### SciVis Renderer

The SciVis renderer is a fast ray tracer for scientific visualization
which supports volume rendering and ambient occlusion (AO). It is
created by passing the type string “`scivis`” to `ospNewRenderer`. In
addition to the [general parameters](#renderer) understood by all
renderers, the SciVis renderer supports the following parameters:

| Type  | Name               | Default | Description                                                                                                             |
|:------|:-------------------|--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| bool  | shadows            |   false | whether to compute (hard) shadows                                                                                       |
| int   | aoSamples          |       0 | number of rays per sample to compute ambient occlusion                                                                  |
| float | aoDistance         |  10^20^ | maximum distance to consider for ambient occlusion                                                                      |
| float | volumeSamplingRate |       1 | sampling rate for volumes                                                                                               |
| bool  | visibleLights      |   false | whether light sources are potentially visible (as in the [path tracer](#path-tracer), regarding each light’s `visible`) |

: Special parameters understood by the SciVis renderer.

Note that the intensity (and color) of AO is deduced from an [ambient
light](#ambient-light) in the `lights` array.[^7] If `aoSamples` is zero
(the default) then ambient lights cause ambient illumination (without
occlusion).

### Ambient Occlusion Renderer

This renderer supports only a subset of the features of the [SciVis
renderer](#scivis-renderer) to gain performance. As the name suggest its
main shading method is ambient occlusion (AO), [lights](#lights) are
*not* considered at all and , Volume rendering is supported. The Ambient
Occlusion renderer is created by passing the type string “`ao`” to
`ospNewRenderer`. In addition to the [general parameters](#renderer)
understood by all renderers the following parameters are supported as
well:

| Type  | Name               | Default | Description                                            |
|:------|:-------------------|--------:|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| int   | aoSamples          |       1 | number of rays per sample to compute ambient occlusion |
| float | aoDistance         |  10^20^ | maximum distance to consider for ambient occlusion     |

### Path Tracer

The path tracer supports soft shadows, indirect illumination and
realistic materials. This renderer is created by passing the type string
“`pathtracer`” to `ospNewRenderer`. In addition to the [general
parameters](#renderer) understood by all renderers the path tracer
supports the following special parameters:

| Type  | Name                 | Default | Description                                                                               |
|:------|:---------------------|--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| int   | lightSamples         |     all | number of random light samples per path vertex, per default all light sources are sampled |
| int   | roulettePathLength   |       5 | ray recursion depth at which to start Russian roulette termination                        |
| float | maxContribution      |       ∞ | samples are clamped to this value before they are accumulated into the framebuffer        |
| bool  | backgroundRefraction |   false | allow for alpha blending even if background is seen through refractive objects like glass |

: Special parameters understood by the path tracer.

The path tracer requires that [materials](#materials) are assigned to
[geometries](#geometries), otherwise surfaces are treated as completely
black.

The path tracer supports [volumes](#volumes) with multiple scattering.
The scattering albedo can be specified using the [transfer
function](#transfer-function). Extinction is assumed to be spectrally
constant.

### Materials

Materials describe how light interacts with surfaces, they give objects
their distinctive look. To let the given renderer create a new material
of given type `type` call

``` {.cpp}
OSPMaterial ospNewMaterial(const char *renderer_type, const char *material_type);
```

The returned handle can then be used to assign the material to a given
geometry with

``` {.cpp}
void ospSetObject(OSPGeometricModel, "material", OSPMaterial);
```

#### OBJ Material

The OBJ material is the workhorse material supported by both the [SciVis
renderer](#scivis-renderer) and the [path tracer](#path-tracer) (the
[Ambient Occlusion renderer](#ambient-occlusion-renderer) only uses the
`kd` and `d` parameter). It offers widely used common properties like
diffuse and specular reflection and is based on the [MTL material
format](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/mtl/) of Lightwave’s OBJ scene
files. To create an OBJ material pass the type string “`obj`” to
`ospNewMaterial`. Its main parameters are

| Type       | Name     |   Default | Description                                        |
|:-----------|:---------|----------:|:---------------------------------------------------|
| vec3f      | kd       | white 0.8 | diffuse color                                      |
| vec3f      | ks       |     black | specular color                                     |
| float      | ns       |        10 | shininess (Phong exponent), usually in \[2–10^4^\] |
| float      | d        |    opaque | opacity                                            |
| vec3f      | tf       |     black | transparency filter color                          |
| OSPTexture | map_bump |      NULL | normal map                                         |

: Main parameters of the OBJ material.

In particular when using the path tracer it is important to adhere to
the principle of energy conservation, i.e., that the amount of light
reflected by a surface is not larger than the light arriving. Therefore
the path tracer issues a warning and renormalizes the color parameters
if the sum of `Kd`, `Ks`, and `Tf` is larger than one in any color
channel. Similarly important to mention is that almost all materials of
the real world reflect at most only about 80% of the incoming light. So
even for a white sheet of paper or white wall paint do better not set
`Kd` larger than 0.8; otherwise rendering times are unnecessary long and
the contrast in the final images is low (for example, the corners of a
white room would hardly be discernible, as can be seen in the figure
below).

<figure>
<img src="https://ospray.github.io/images/diffuse_rooms.png" width="80.0%" alt="Comparison of diffuse rooms with 100% reflecting white paint (left) and realistic 80% reflecting white paint (right), which leads to higher overall contrast. Note that exposure has been adjusted to achieve similar brightness levels." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Comparison of diffuse rooms with 100% reflecting white paint (left) and realistic 80% reflecting white paint (right), which leads to higher overall contrast. Note that exposure has been adjusted to achieve similar brightness levels.</figcaption>
</figure>



If present, the color component of [geometries](#geometries) is also
used for the diffuse color `Kd` and the alpha component is also used for
the opacity `d`.

Normal mapping can simulate small geometric features via the texture
`map_Bump`. The normals $n$ in the normal map are with respect to the
local tangential shading coordinate system and are encoded as $½(n+1)$,
thus a texel $(0.5, 0.5, 1)$[^8] represents the unperturbed shading
normal $(0, 0, 1)$. Because of this encoding an sRGB gamma
[texture](#texture) format is ignored and normals are always fetched as
linear from a normal map. Note that the orientation of normal maps is
important for a visually consistent look: by convention OSPRay uses a
coordinate system with the origin in the lower left corner; thus a
convexity will look green toward the top of the texture image (see also
the example image of a normal map). If this is not the case flip the
normal map vertically or invert its green channel.

</figure>



Note that `Tf` colored transparency is implemented in the SciVis and the
path tracer but normal mapping with `map_Bump` is currently supported in
the path tracer only.

All parameters (except `Tf`) can be textured by passing a
[texture](#texture) handle, prefixed with “`map_`”. The fetched texels
are multiplied by the respective parameter value. If only the texture is
given (but not the corresponding parameter), only the texture is used
(the default value of the parameter is *not* multiplied). The color
textures `map_Kd` and `map_Ks` are typically in one of the sRGB gamma
encoded formats, whereas textures `map_Ns` and `map_d` are usually in a
linear format (and only the first component is used). Additionally, all
textures support [texture transformations](#texture-transformations).

#### Principled

The Principled material is the most complex material offered by the
[path tracer](#path-tracer), which is capable of producing a wide
variety of materials (e.g., plastic, metal, wood, glass) by combining
multiple different layers and lobes. It uses the GGX microfacet
distribution with approximate multiple scattering for dielectrics and
metals, uses the Oren-Nayar model for diffuse reflection, and is energy
conserving. To create a Principled material, pass the type string
“`principled`” to `ospNewMaterial`. Its parameters are listed in the
table below.

| Type      | Name      |   Default | Description                                                                                                                                              |

: Parameters of the Metal material.

The main appearance (mostly the color) of the Metal material is
controlled by the physical parameters `eta` and `k`, the
wavelength-dependent, complex index of refraction. These coefficients
are quite counter-intuitive but can be found in [published
measurements](https://refractiveindex.info/). For accuracy the index of
refraction can be given as an array of spectral samples in `ior`, each
sample a triplet of wavelength (in nm), eta, and k, ordered
monotonically increasing by wavelength; OSPRay will then calculate the
Fresnel in the spectral domain. Alternatively, `eta` and `k` can also be
specified as approximated RGB coefficients; some examples are given in
below table.

| Metal         |          eta          |        k        |
|:--------------|:---------------------:|:---------------:|
| Ag, Silver    | (0.051, 0.043, 0.041) | (5.3, 3.6, 2.3) |
| Al, Aluminium |   (1.5, 0.98, 0.6)    | (7.6, 6.6, 5.4) |
| Au, Gold      |   (0.07, 0.37, 1.5)   | (3.7, 2.3, 1.7) |
| Cr, Chromium  |    (3.2, 3.1, 2.3)    | (3.3, 3.3, 3.1) |
| Cu, Copper    |    (0.1, 0.8, 1.1)    | (3.5, 2.5, 2.4) |

: Index of refraction of selected metals as approximated RGB
coefficients, based on data from https://refractiveindex.info/.

The `roughness` parameter controls the variation of microfacets and thus
how polished the metal will look. The roughness can be modified by a
[texture](#texture) `map_roughness` ([texture
transformations](#texture-transformations) are supported as well) to
create notable edging effects.

</figure>



#### Alloy

The [path tracer](#path-tracer) offers an alloy material, which behaves
similar to [Metal](#metal), but allows for more intuitive and flexible
control of the color. To create an Alloy material pass the type string
“`alloy`” to `ospNewMaterial`. Its parameters are

| Type  | Name      |   Default | Description                                 |
|:------|:----------|----------:|:--------------------------------------------|
| vec3f | color     | white 0.9 | reflectivity at normal incidence (0 degree) |
| vec3f | edgeColor |     white | reflectivity at grazing angle (90 degree)   |
| float | roughness |       0.1 | roughness, in \[0–1\], 0 is perfect mirror  |

: Parameters of the Alloy material.

The main appearance of the Alloy material is controlled by the parameter
`color`, while `edgeColor` influences the tint of reflections when seen
at grazing angles (for real metals this is always 100% white). If
present, the color component of [geometries](#geometries) is also used
for reflectivity at normal incidence `color`. As in [Metal](#metal) the
`roughness` parameter controls the variation of microfacets and thus how
polished the alloy will look. All parameters can be textured by passing
a [texture](#texture) handle, prefixed with “`map_`”; [texture
transformations](#texture-transformations) are supported as well.

#### Glass

The [path tracer](#path-tracer) offers a realistic a glass material,
supporting refraction and volumetric attenuation (i.e., the transparency
color varies with the geometric thickness). To create a Glass material
pass the type string “`glass`” to `ospNewMaterial`. Its parameters are

| Type  | Name                | Default | Description                        |
|:------|:--------------------|--------:|:-----------------------------------|
| float | eta                 |     1.5 | index of refraction                |
| vec3f | attenuationColor    |   white | resulting color due to attenuation |
| float | attenuationDistance |       1 | distance affecting attenuation     |

: Parameters of the Glass material.

For convenience, the rather counter-intuitive physical attenuation
coefficients will be calculated from the user inputs in such a way, that
the `attenuationColor` will be the result when white light traveled
trough a glass of thickness `attenuationDistance`.

<img src="https://ospray.github.io/images/material_Glass.jpg" width="60.0%" alt="Rendering of a Glass material with orange attenuation." /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Rendering of a Glass material with orange attenuation.</figcaption>
</figure>



#### ThinGlass

The [path tracer](#path-tracer) offers a thin glass material useful for
objects with just a single surface, most prominently windows. It models
a thin, transparent slab, i.e., it behaves as if a second, virtual
surface is parallel to the real geometric surface. The implementation
accounts for multiple internal reflections between the interfaces
(including attenuation), but neglects parallax effects due to its
(virtual) thickness. To create a such a thin glass material pass the
type string “`thinGlass`” to `ospNewMaterial`. Its parameters are

| Type  | Name                | Default | Description                        |
|:------|:--------------------|--------:|:-----------------------------------|
| float | eta                 |     1.5 | index of refraction                |
| vec3f | attenuationColor    |   white | resulting color due to attenuation |
| float | attenuationDistance |       1 | distance affecting attenuation     |
| float | thickness           |       1 | virtual thickness                  |

: Parameters of the ThinGlass material.

For convenience the attenuation is controlled the same way as with the
[Glass](#glass) material. Additionally, the color due to attenuation can
be modulated with a [texture](#texture) `map_attenuationColor` ([texture
transformations](#texture-transformations) are supported as well). If
present, the color component of [geometries](#geometries) is also used
for the attenuation color. The `thickness` parameter sets the (virtual)
thickness and allows for easy exchange of parameters with the (real)
[Glass](#glass) material; internally just the ratio between
`attenuationDistance` and `thickness` is used to calculate the resulting
attenuation and thus the material appearance.

</figure>



#### MetallicPaint

The [path tracer](#path-tracer) offers a metallic paint material,
consisting of a base coat with optional flakes and a clear coat. To
create a MetallicPaint material pass the type string “`metallicPaint`”
to `ospNewMaterial`. Its parameters are listed in the table below.

| Type  | Name        |   Default | Description                       |
|:------|:------------|----------:|:----------------------------------|
| vec3f | baseColor   | white 0.8 | color of base coat                |
| float | flakeAmount |       0.3 | amount of flakes, in \[0–1\]      |
| vec3f | flakeColor  | Aluminium | color of metallic flakes          |
| float | flakeSpread |       0.5 | spread of flakes, in \[0–1\]      |
| float | eta         |       1.5 | index of refraction of clear coat |

: Parameters of the MetallicPaint material.

The color of the base coat `baseColor` can be textured by a
[texture](#texture) `map_baseColor`, which also supports [texture
transformations](#texture-transformations). If present, the color
component of [geometries](#geometries) is also used for the color of the
base coat. Parameter `flakeAmount` controls the proportion of flakes in
the base coat, so when setting it to 1 the `baseColor` will not be
visible. The shininess of the metallic component is governed by
`flakeSpread`, which controls the variation of the orientation of the
flakes, similar to the `roughness` parameter of [Metal](#metal). Note
that the effect of the metallic flakes is currently only computed on
average, thus individual flakes are not visible.

#### Luminous

The [path tracer](#path-tracer) supports the Luminous material which
emits light uniformly in all directions and which can thus be used to
turn any geometric object into a light source[^9]. It is created by
passing the type string “`luminous`” to `ospNewMaterial`. The amount of
constant radiance that is emitted is determined by combining the general
parameters of lights: [`color` and `intensity`](#lights) (which
essentially means that parameter `intensityQuantity` is not needed
because it is always `OSP_INTENSITY_QUANTITY_RADIANCE`).

| Type  | Name         | Default | Description                       |
|:------|:-------------|--------:|:----------------------------------|
| vec3f | color        |   white | color of the emitted light        |
| float | intensity    |       1 | intensity of the light (a factor) |
| float | transparency |       1 | material transparency             |

: Parameters accepted by the Luminous material.

### Texture

OSPRay currently implements two texture types (`texture2d` and `volume`)
and is open for extension to other types by applications. More types may
be added in future releases.

To create a new texture use

``` {.cpp}
OSPTexture ospNewTexture(const char *type);
```

#### Texture2D

The `texture2d` texture type implements an image-based texture, where
its parameters are as follows

| Type    | Name   | Description                                                                       |
|:--------|:-------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| int     | format | `OSPTextureFormat` for the texture                                                |
| int     | filter | default `OSP_TEXTURE_FILTER_BILINEAR`, alternatively `OSP_TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST` |
| OSPData | data   | the actual texel 2D [data](#data)                                                 |

: Parameters of `texture2d` texture type.

The supported texture formats for `texture2d` are:

| Name                | Description                                                                |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OSP_TEXTURE_RGBA8   | 8 bit \[0–255\] linear components red, green, blue, alpha                  |
| OSP_TEXTURE_SRGBA   | 8 bit sRGB gamma encoded color components, and linear alpha                |
| OSP_TEXTURE_RGBA32F | 32 bit float components red, green, blue, alpha                            |
| OSP_TEXTURE_RGB8    | 8 bit \[0–255\] linear components red, green, blue                         |
| OSP_TEXTURE_SRGB    | 8 bit sRGB gamma encoded components red, green, blue                       |
| OSP_TEXTURE_RGB32F  | 32 bit float components red, green, blue                                   |
| OSP_TEXTURE_R8      | 8 bit \[0–255\] linear single component red                                |
| OSP_TEXTURE_RA8     | 8 bit \[0–255\] linear two components red, alpha                           |
| OSP_TEXTURE_L8      | 8 bit \[0–255\] gamma encoded luminance (replicated into red, green, blue) |
| OSP_TEXTURE_LA8     | 8 bit \[0–255\] gamma encoded luminance, and linear alpha                  |
| OSP_TEXTURE_R32F    | 32 bit float single component red                                          |
| OSP_TEXTURE_RGBA16  | 16 bit \[0–65535\] linear components red, green, blue, alpha               |
| OSP_TEXTURE_RGB16   | 16 bit \[0–65535\] linear components red, green, blue                      |
| OSP_TEXTURE_RA16    | 16 bit \[0–65535\] linear two components red, alpha                        |
| OSP_TEXTURE_R16     | 16 bit \[0–65535\] linear single component red                             |

: Supported texture formats by `texture2d`, i.e., valid constants of
type `OSPTextureFormat`.

The size of the texture is inferred from the size of the 2D array
`data`, which also needs have a compatible type to `format`. The texel
data in `data` starts with the texels in the lower left corner of the
texture image, like in OpenGL. Per default a texture fetch is filtered
by performing bi-linear interpolation of the nearest 2×2 texels; if
instead fetching only the nearest texel is desired (i.e., no filtering)
then pass the `OSP_TEXTURE_FILTER_NEAREST` flag.

Texturing with `texture2d` image textures requires
[geometries](#geometries) with texture coordinates, e.g., a
[mesh](#mesh) with `vertex.texcoord` provided.

#### Volume Texture

The `volume` texture type implements texture lookups based on 3D object
coordinates of the surface hit point on the associated geometry. If the
given hit point is within the attached volume, the volume is sampled and
classified with the transfer function attached to the volume. This
implements the ability to visualize volume values (as colored by a
transfer function) on arbitrary surfaces inside the volume (as opposed
to an isosurface showing a particular value in the volume). Its
parameters are as follows

| Type                | Name             | Description                                       |
|:--------------------|:-----------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| OSPVolume           | volume           | [Volume](#volumes) used to generate color lookups |
| OSPTransferFunction | transferFunction | \[TransferFunction\] applied to `volume`          |

: Parameters of `volume` texture type.

TextureVolume can be used for implementing slicing of volumes with any
geometry type. It enables coloring of the slicing geometry with a
different transfer function than that of the sliced volume.

#### Texture Transformations

All materials with textures also offer to manipulate the placement of
these textures with the help of texture transformations. If so, this
convention shall be used: the following parameters are prefixed with
“`texture_name.`”).

| Type     | Name        | Description                                      |
|:---------|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| linear2f | transform   | linear transformation (rotation, scale)          |
| float    | rotation    | angle in degree, counterclockwise, around center |
| vec2f    | scale       | enlarge texture, relative to center (0.5, 0.5)   |
| vec2f    | translation | move texture in positive direction (right/up)    |

: Parameters to define 2D texture coordinate transformations.

Above parameters are combined into a single `affine2d` transformation
matrix and the transformations are applied in the given order. Rotation,
scale and translation are interpreted “texture centric”, i.e., their
effect seen by an user are relative to the texture (although the
transformations are applied to the texture coordinates).

| Type     | Name      | Description                                              |
|:---------|:----------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| affine3f | transform | linear transformation (rotation, scale) plus translation |

: Parameter to define 3D volume texture transformations.

Similarly, volume texture placement can also be modified by an
`affine3f` transformation matrix.

### Cameras

To create a new camera of given type `type` use

``` {.cpp}
OSPCamera ospNewCamera(const char *type);
```

All cameras accept these parameters:

| Type  | Name       | Description                               |
|:------|:-----------|:------------------------------------------|
| vec3f | position   | position of the camera in world-space     |
| vec3f | direction  | main viewing direction of the camera      |
| vec3f | up         | up direction of the camera                |
| float | nearClip   | near clipping distance                    |
| vec2f | imageStart | start of image region (lower left corner) |
| vec2f | imageEnd   | end of image region (upper right corner)  |

: Parameters accepted by all cameras.

The camera is placed and oriented in the world with `position`,
`direction` and `up`. OSPRay uses a right-handed coordinate system. The
region of the camera sensor that is rendered to the image can be
specified in normalized screen-space coordinates with `imageStart`
(lower left corner) and `imageEnd` (upper right corner). This can be
used, for example, to crop the image, to achieve asymmetrical view
frusta, or to horizontally flip the image to view scenes which are
specified in a left-handed coordinate system. Note that values outside
the default range of \[0–1\] are valid, which is useful to easily
realize overscan or film gate, or to emulate a shifted sensor.

#### Perspective Camera

The perspective camera implements a simple thin lens camera for
perspective rendering, supporting optionally depth of field and stereo
rendering, but no motion blur. It is created by passing the type string
“`perspective`” to `ospNewCamera`. In addition to the [general
parameters](#cameras) understood by all cameras the perspective camera
supports the special parameters listed in the table below.

| Type  | Name                   | Description                                                                |
|:------|:-----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| float | fovy                   | the field of view (angle in degree) of the frame’s height                  |
| float | aspect                 | ratio of width by height of the frame (and image region)                   |
| float | apertureRadius         | size of the aperture, controls the depth of field                          |
| float | focusDistance          | distance at where the image is sharpest when depth of field is enabled     |
| bool  | architectural          | vertical edges are projected to be parallel                                |
| uchar | stereoMode             | `OSPStereoMode` for stereo rendering, possible values are:                 |
|       |                        | `OSP_STEREO_NONE` (default)                                                |
|       |                        | `OSP_STEREO_LEFT`                                                          |
|       |                        | `OSP_STEREO_RIGHT`                                                         |
|       |                        | `OSP_STEREO_SIDE_BY_SIDE`                                                  |
|       |                        | `OSP_STEREO_TOP_BOTTOM` (left eye at top half)                             |
| float | interpupillaryDistance | distance between left and right eye when stereo is enabled, default 0.0635 |

: Additional parameters accepted by the perspective camera.

Note that when computing the `aspect` ratio a potentially set image
region (using `imageStart` & `imageEnd`) needs to be regarded as well.

In architectural photography it is often desired for aesthetic reasons
to display the vertical edges of buildings or walls vertically in the
image as well, regardless of how the camera is tilted. Enabling the
`architectural` mode achieves this by internally leveling the camera
parallel to the ground (based on the `up` direction) and then shifting
the lens such that the objects in direction `dir` are centered in the
image. If finer control of the lens shift is needed use `imageStart` &
`imageEnd`. Because the camera is now effectively leveled its image
plane and thus the plane of focus is oriented parallel to the front of
buildings, the whole façade appears sharp, as can be seen in the example
images below. The resolution of the [framebuffer](#framebuffer) is not
altered by `imageStart`/`imageEnd`.

#### Orthographic Camera

The orthographic camera implements a simple camera with orthographic
projection, without support for depth of field or motion blur. It is
created by passing the type string “`orthographic`” to `ospNewCamera`.
In addition to the [general parameters](#cameras) understood by all
cameras the orthographic camera supports the following special
parameters:

| Type  | Name   | Description                                                 |
|:------|:-------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| float | height | size of the camera’s image plane in y, in world coordinates |
| float | aspect | ratio of width by height of the frame                       |

: Additional parameters accepted by the orthographic camera.

For convenience the size of the camera sensor, and thus the extent of
the scene that is captured in the image, can be controlled with the
`height` parameter. The same effect can be achieved with `imageStart`
and `imageEnd`, and both methods can be combined. In any case, the
`aspect` ratio needs to be set accordingly to get an undistorted image.

#### Panoramic Camera

The panoramic camera implements a simple camera with support for stereo
rendering. It captures the complete surrounding with a latitude /
longitude mapping and thus the rendered images should best have a ratio
of 2:1. A panoramic camera is created by passing the type string
“`panoramic`” to `ospNewCamera`. It is placed and oriented in the scene
by using the [general parameters](#cameras) understood by all cameras.

| Type  | Name                   | Description                                                                |
|:------|:-----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| uchar | stereoMode             | `OSPStereoMode` for stereo rendering, possible values are:                 |
|       |                        | `OSP_STEREO_NONE` (default)                                                |
|       |                        | `OSP_STEREO_LEFT`                                                          |
|       |                        | `OSP_STEREO_RIGHT`                                                         |
|       |                        | `OSP_STEREO_SIDE_BY_SIDE`                                                  |
|       |                        | `OSP_STEREO_TOP_BOTTOM` (left eye at top half)                             |
| float | interpupillaryDistance | distance between left and right eye when stereo is enabled, default 0.0635 |

: Additional parameters accepted by the panoramic camera.

### Picking

To get the world-space position of the geometry (if any) seen at \[0–1\]
normalized screen-space pixel coordinates `screenPos_x` and
`screenPos_y` use

``` {.cpp}
void ospPick(OSPPickResult *,
    OSPFrameBuffer,
    OSPRenderer,
    OSPCamera,
    OSPWorld,
    float screenPos_x,
    float screenPos_y);
```

The result is returned in the provided `OSPPickResult` struct:

``` {.cpp}
typedef struct {
    int hasHit;
    float worldPosition[3];
    OSPInstance instance;
    OSPGeometricModel model;
    uint32_t primID;
} OSPPickResult;
```

Note that `ospPick` considers exactly the same camera of the given
renderer that is used to render an image, thus matching results can be
expected. If the camera supports depth of field then the center of the
lens and thus the center of the circle of confusion is used for picking.
Note that the caller needs to `ospRelease` the `instance` and `model`
handles of `OSPPickResult` once the information is not needed anymore.

Framebuffer
-----------

The framebuffer holds the rendered 2D image (and optionally auxiliary
information associated with pixels). To create a new framebuffer object
of given size `size` (in pixels), color format, and channels use

``` {.cpp}
OSPFrameBuffer ospNewFrameBuffer(int size_x, int size_y,
    OSPFrameBufferFormat format = OSP_FB_SRGBA,
    uint32_t frameBufferChannels = OSP_FB_COLOR);
```

The parameter `format` describes the format the color buffer has *on the
host*, and the format that `ospMapFrameBuffer` will eventually return.
Valid values are:

| Name           | Description                                                 |
|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| OSP_FB_NONE    | framebuffer will not be mapped by the application           |
| OSP_FB_RGBA8   | 8 bit \[0–255\] linear component red, green, blue, alpha    |
| OSP_FB_SRGBA   | 8 bit sRGB gamma encoded color components, and linear alpha |
| OSP_FB_RGBA32F | 32 bit float components red, green, blue, alpha             |

: Supported color formats of the framebuffer that can be passed to
`ospNewFrameBuffer`, i.e., valid constants of type
`OSPFrameBufferFormat`.

The parameter `frameBufferChannels` specifies which channels the
framebuffer holds, and can be combined together by bitwise OR from the
values of `OSPFrameBufferChannel` listed in the table below.

| Name            | Description                                                                                                                                |
|:----------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OSP_FB_COLOR    | RGB color including alpha                                                                                                                  |
| OSP_FB_DEPTH    | euclidean distance to the camera (*not* to the image plane), as linear 32 bit float; for multiple samples per pixel their minimum is taken |
| OSP_FB_ACCUM    | accumulation buffer for progressive refinement                                                                                             |
| OSP_FB_VARIANCE | for estimation of the current noise level if OSP_FB_ACCUM is also present, see [rendering](#rendering)                                     |
| OSP_FB_NORMAL   | accumulated world-space normal of the first hit, as vec3f                                                                                  |
| OSP_FB_ALBEDO   | accumulated material albedo (color without illumination) at the first hit, as vec3f                                                        |

: Framebuffer channels constants (of type `OSPFrameBufferChannel`),
naming optional information the framebuffer can store. These values can
be combined by bitwise OR when passed to `ospNewFrameBuffer`.

If a certain channel value is *not* specified, the given buffer channel
will not be present. Note that OSPRay makes a clear distinction between
the *external* format of the framebuffer and the internal one: The
external format is the format the user specifies in the `format`
parameter; it specifies what color format OSPRay will eventually
*return* the framebuffer to the application (when calling
`ospMapFrameBuffer`): no matter what OSPRay uses internally, it will
simply return a 2D array of pixels of that format, with possibly all
kinds of reformatting, compression/decompression, etc., going on
in-between the generation of the *internal* framebuffer and the mapping
of the externally visible one.

In particular, `OSP_FB_NONE` is a perfectly valid pixel format for a
framebuffer that an application will never map. For example, an
application driving a display wall may well generate an intermediate
framebuffer and eventually transfer its pixel to the individual displays
using an `OSPImageOperation` [image operation](#image-operation).

The application can map the given channel of a framebuffer – and thus
access the stored pixel information – via

``` {.cpp}
const void *ospMapFrameBuffer(OSPFrameBuffer, OSPFrameBufferChannel = OSP_FB_COLOR);
```

Note that `OSP_FB_ACCUM` or `OSP_FB_VARIANCE` cannot be mapped. The
origin of the screen coordinate system in OSPRay is the lower left
corner (as in OpenGL), thus the first pixel addressed by the returned
pointer is the lower left pixel of the image.

A previously mapped channel of a framebuffer can be unmapped by passing
the received pointer `mapped` to

``` {.cpp}
void ospUnmapFrameBuffer(const void *mapped, OSPFrameBuffer);
```

The individual channels of a framebuffer can be cleared with

``` {.cpp}
void ospResetAccumulation(OSPFrameBuffer);
```

This function will clear *all* accumulating buffers (`OSP_FB_VARIANCE`,
`OSP_FB_NORMAL`, and `OSP_FB_ALBEDO`, if present) and resets the
accumulation counter `accumID`. It is unspecified if the existing color
and depth buffers are physically cleared when `ospResetAccumulation` is
called.

If `OSP_FB_VARIANCE` is specified, an estimate of the variance of the
last accumulated frame can be queried with

``` {.cpp}
float ospGetVariance(OSPFrameBuffer);
```

Note this value is only updated after synchronizing with
`OSP_FRAME_FINISHED`, as further described in [asynchronous
rendering](#asynchronous-rendering). The estimated variance can be used
by the application as a quality indicator and thus to decide whether to
stop or to continue progressive rendering.

The framebuffer takes a list of pixel operations to be applied to the
image in sequence as an `OSPData`. The pixel operations will be run in
the order they are in the array.

| Type                  | Name           | Description                          |
|:----------------------|:---------------|:-------------------------------------|
| OSPImageOperation\[\] | imageOperation | ordered sequence of image operations |

: Parameters accepted by the framebuffer.

### Image Operation

Image operations are functions that are applied to every pixel of a
frame. Examples include post-processing, filtering, blending, tone
mapping, or sending tiles to a display wall. To create a new pixel
operation of given type `type` use

``` {.cpp}
OSPImageOperation ospNewImageOperation(const char *type);
```

#### Tone Mapper

The tone mapper is a pixel operation which implements a generic filmic
tone mapping operator. Using the default parameters it approximates the
Academy Color Encoding System (ACES). The tone mapper is created by
passing the type string “`tonemapper`” to `ospNewImageOperation`. The
tone mapping curve can be customized using the parameters listed in the
table below.

| Type  | Name      | Default | Description                                                              |
|:------|:----------|:--------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| float | exposure  | 1.0     | amount of light per unit area                                            |
| float | contrast  | 1.6773  | contrast (toe of the curve); typically is in \[1–2\]                     |
| float | shoulder  | 0.9714  | highlight compression (shoulder of the curve); typically is in \[0.9–1\] |
| float | midIn     | 0.18    | mid-level anchor input; default is 18% gray                              |
| float | midOut    | 0.18    | mid-level anchor output; default is 18% gray                             |
| float | hdrMax    | 11.0785 | maximum HDR input that is not clipped                                    |
| bool  | acesColor | true    | apply the ACES color transforms                                          |

: Parameters accepted by the tone mapper.

To use the popular “Uncharted 2” filmic tone mapping curve instead, set
the parameters to the values listed in the table below.

| Name      | Value  |
|:----------|:-------|
| contrast  | 1.1759 |
| shoulder  | 0.9746 |
| midIn     | 0.18   |
| midOut    | 0.18   |
| hdrMax    | 6.3704 |
| acesColor | false  |

: Filmic tone mapping curve parameters. Note that the curve includes an
exposure bias to match 18% middle gray.

#### Denoiser

OSPRay comes with a module that adds support for Intel® Open Image
Denoise. This is provided as an optional module as it creates an
additional project dependency at compile time. The module implements a
“`denoiser`” frame operation, which denoises the entire frame before the
frame is completed.

Rendering
---------

### Asynchronous Rendering

Rendering is by default asynchronous (non-blocking), and is done by
combining a framebuffer, renderer, camera, and world.

What to render and how to render it depends on the renderer’s
parameters. If the framebuffer supports accumulation (i.e., it was
created with `OSP_FB_ACCUM`) then successive calls to `ospRenderFrame`
will progressively refine the rendered image.

To start an render task, use

``` {.cpp}
OSPFuture ospRenderFrame(OSPFrameBuffer, OSPRenderer, OSPCamera, OSPWorld);
```

This returns an `OSPFuture` handle, which can be used to synchronize
with the application, cancel, or query for progress of the running task.
When `ospRenderFrame` is called, there is no guarantee when the
associated task will begin execution.

Progress of a running frame can be queried with the following API
function

``` {.cpp}
float ospGetProgress(OSPFuture);
```

This returns the approximated progress of the task in \[0-1\].

Applications can cancel a currently running asynchronous operation via

``` {.cpp}
void ospCancel(OSPFuture);
```

Applications can wait on the result of an asynchronous operation, or
choose to only synchronize with a specific event. To synchronize with an
`OSPFuture` use

``` {.cpp}
void ospWait(OSPFuture, OSPSyncEvent = OSP_TASK_FINISHED);
```

The following are values which can be synchronized with the application

| Name                | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|:--------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OSP_NONE_FINISHED   | Do not wait for anything to be finished (immediately return from `ospWait`)                                                                     |
| OSP_WORLD_COMMITTED | Wait for the world to be committed (not yet implemented)                                                                                        |
| OSP_WORLD_RENDERED  | Wait for the world to be rendered, but not post-processing operations (Pixel/Tile/Frame Op)                                                     |
| OSP_FRAME_FINISHED  | Wait for all rendering operations to complete                                                                                                   |
| OSP_TASK_FINISHED   | Wait on full completion of the task associated with the future. The underlying task may involve one or more of the above synchronization events |

: Supported events that can be passed to `ospWait`.

Currently only rendering can be invoked asynchronously. However, future
releases of OSPRay may add more asynchronous versions of API calls (and
thus return `OSPFuture`).

Applications can query whether particular events are complete with

``` {.cpp}
int ospIsReady(OSPFuture, OSPSyncEvent = OSP_TASK_FINISHED);
```

As the given running task runs (as tracked by the `OSPFuture`),
applications can query a boolean \[0,1\] result if the passed event has
been completed.

Applications can query how long an async task ran with

``` {.cpp}
float ospGetTaskDuration(OSPFuture);
```

This returns the wall clock execution time of the task in seconds. If
the task is still running, this will block until the task is completed.
This is useful for applications to query exactly how long an
asynchronous task executed without the overhead of measuring both task
execution + synchronization by the calling application.

### Asynchronously Rendering and ospCommit()

The use of either `ospRenderFrame` or `ospRenderFrame` requires that all
objects in the scene being rendered have been committed before rendering
occurs. If a call to `ospCommit()` happens while a frame is rendered,
the result is undefined behavior and should be avoided.

### Synchronous Rendering

For convenience in certain use cases, `ospray_util.h` provides a
synchronous version of `ospRenderFrame`:

``` {.cpp}
float ospRenderFrameBlocking(OSPFrameBuffer, OSPRenderer, OSPCamera, OSPWorld);
```

This version is the equivalent of:

``` {.cpp}
ospRenderFrame
ospWait(f, OSP_TASK_FINISHED)
return ospGetVariance(fb)
```

This version is closest to `ospRenderFrame` from OSPRay v1.x.

Distributed rendering with MPI
==============================

The purpose of the MPI module for OSPRay is to provide distributed
rendering capabilities for OSPRay. The module enables image- and
data-parallel rendering across HPC clusters using MPI, allowing
applications to transparently distribute rendering work, or to render
data sets which are too large to fit in memory on a single machine.

The MPI module provides two OSPRay devices to allow applications to
leverage distributed rendering capabilities. The `mpiOffload` device
provides transparent image-parallel rendering, where the same OSPRay
application written for local rendering can be replicated across
multiple nodes to distribute the rendering work. The `mpiDistributed`
device allows MPI distributed applications to use OSPRay for distributed
rendering, where each rank can render and independent piece of a global
data set, or hybrid rendering where ranks partially or completely share
data.

MPI Offload Rendering
---------------------

The `mpiOffload` device can be used to distribute image rendering tasks
across a cluster without requiring modifications to the application
itself. Existing applications using OSPRay for local rendering simply be
passed command line arguments to load the module and indicate that the
`mpiOffload` device should be used for image-parallel rendering. To load
the module, pass `--osp:load-modules=mpi`, to select the
MPIOffloadDevice, pass `--osp:device=mpiOffload`. For example, the
`ospExamples` application can be run as:

``` {.sh}
mpirun -n <N> ./ospExamples --osp:load-modules=mpi --osp:device=mpiOffload
```

and will automatically distribute the image rendering tasks among the
corresponding `N` nodes. Note that in this configuration rank 0 will act
as a master/application rank, and will run the user application code but
not perform rendering locally. Thus, a minimum of 2 ranks are required,
one master to run the application and one worker to perform the
rendering. Running with 3 ranks for example would now distribute half
the image rendering work to rank 1 and half to rank 2.

If more control is required over the placement of ranks to nodes, or you
want to run a worker rank on the master node as well you can run the
application and the `ospray_mpi_worker` program through MPI’s MPMD mode.
The `ospray_mpi_worker` will load the MPI module and select the offload
device by default.

``` {.sh}
mpirun -n 1 ./ospExamples --osp:load-modules=mpi --osp:device=mpiOffload \
  : -n <N> ./ospray_mpi_worker
```

If initializing the `mpiOffload` device manually, or passing parameters
through the command line, the following parameters can be set:

| Type   | Name                    | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|:-------|:------------------------|--------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| string | mpiMode                 |     mpi | The mode to communicate with the worker ranks. `mpi` will assume you’re launching the application and workers in the same mpi command (or split launch command). `mpi` is the only supported mode |
| uint   | maxCommandBufferEntries |    8192 | Set the max number of commands to buffer before submitting the command buffer to the workers                                                                                                      |
| uint   | commandBufferSize       | 512 MiB | Set the max command buffer size to allow. Units are in MiB. Max size is 1.8GiB                                                                                                                    |
| uint   | maxInlineDataSize       |  32 MiB | Set the max size of an OSPData which can be inline’d into the command buffer instead of being sent separately. Max size is half the commandBufferSize. Units are in MiB                           |

: Parameters specific to the `mpiOffload` Device.

The `maxCommandBufferEntries`, `commandBufferSize`, and
`maxInlineDataSize` can also be set via the environment variables:
`OSPRAY_MPI_MAX_COMMAND_BUFFER_ENTRIES`,
`OSPRAY_MPI_COMMAND_BUFFER_SIZE`, and `OSPRAY_MPI_MAX_INLINE_DATA_SIZE`,
respectively.

MPI Distributed Rendering
-------------------------

While MPI Offload rendering is used to transparently distribute
rendering work without requiring modification to the application, MPI
Distributed rendering is targetted at use of OSPRay within MPI-parallel
applications. The MPI distributed device can be selected by loading the
`mpi` module, and manually creating and using an instance of the
`mpiDistributed` device:

``` {.cpp}
ospLoadModule("mpi");

OSPDevice mpiDevice = ospNewDevice("mpiDistributed");
ospDeviceCommit(mpiDevice);
ospSetCurrentDevice(mpiDevice);
```

Your application can either initialize MPI before-hand, ensuring that
`MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED` or higher is supported, or allow the device to
initialize MPI on commit. Thread multiple support is required if your
application will make MPI calls while rendering asynchronously with
OSPRay. When using the distributed device each rank can specify
independent local data using the OSPRay API, as if rendering locally.
However, when calling `ospRenderFrameAsync` the ranks will work
collectively to render the data. The distributed device supports both
image-parallel, where the data is replicated, and data-parallel, where
the data is distributed, rendering modes. The `mpiDistributed` device
will by default use each rank in `MPI_COMM_WORLD` as a render worker;
however, it can also take a specific MPI communicator to use as the
world communicator. Only those ranks in the specified communicator will
participate in rendering.

| Type    | Name              |        Default | Description                                                               |
|:--------|:------------------|---------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| void \* | worldCommunicator | MPI_COMM_WORLD | The MPI communicator which the OSPRay workers should treat as their world |

### Image Parallel Rendering in the MPI Distributed Device

If all ranks specify exactly the same data, the distributed device can
be used for image-parallel rendering. This works identical to the
offload device, except that the MPI-aware application is able to load
data in parallel on each rank rather than loading on the master and
shipping data out to the workers. When a parallel file system is
available, this can improve data load times. Image-parallel rendering is
selected by specifying the same data on each rank, and using any of the
existing local renderers (e.g., `scivis`, `pathtracer`). See
[ospMPIDistributedTutorialReplicatedData](tutorials/ospMPIDistributedTutorialReplicatedData.cpp)
for an example.

### Data Parallel Rendering in the MPI Distributed Device

The MPI Distributed device also supports data-parallel rendering with
sort-last compositing. Each rank can specify a different piece of data,
as long as the bounding boxes of each rank’s data are non-overlapping.
The rest of the scene setup is similar to local rendering; however, for
distributed rendering only the `mpiRaycast` renderer is supported. This
renderer implements a subset of the `scivis` rendering features which
are suitable for implementation in a distributed environment.

By default the aggregate bounding box of the instances in the local
world will be used as the bounds of that rank’s data. However, when
using ghost zones for volume interpolation, geometry or ambient
occlusion, each rank’s data can overlap. To clip these non-owned overlap
regions out a set of regions (the `region` parameter) can pass as a
parameter to the `OSPWorld` being rendered. Each rank can specify one or
more non-overlapping `box3f`’s which bound the portions of its local
data which it is reponsible for rendering. See the
[ospMPIDistributedTutorialStructuredVolume](tutorials/ospMPIDistributedTutorialStructuredVolume.cpp)
for an example.

Finally, the MPI distributed device also supports hybrid-parallel
rendering, where multiple ranks can share a single piece of data. For
each shared piece of data the rendering work will be assigned
image-parallel among the ranks. Partially-shared regions are determined
by finding those ranks specifying data with the same bounds (matching
regions) and merging them. See the
[ospMPIDistributedTutorialPartiallyReplicatedData](tutorials/ospMPIDistributedTutorialPartiallyReplicatedData.cpp)
for an example.

Interaction With User Modules
-----------------------------

The MPI Offload rendering mode trivially supports user modules, with the
caveat that attempting to share data directly with the application
(e.g., passing a `void *` or other tricks to the module) will not work
in a distributed environment. Instead, use the `ospNewSharedData` API to
share data from the application with OSPRay, which will in turn be
copied over the network to the workers.

The MPI Distributed device also supports user modules, as all that is
required for compositing the distributed data are the bounds of each
rank’s local data.

Tutorials
=========

ospTutorial
-----------

A minimal working example demonstrating how to use OSPRay can be found
at
[`apps/tutorials/ospTutorial.c`](https://github.com/ospray/ospray/blob/master/apps/ospTutorial/ospTutorial.c)[^10].

An example of building `ospTutorial.c` with CMake can be found in
[`apps/tutorials/ospTutorialFindospray/`](https://github.com/ospray/ospray/tree/master/apps/ospTutorial/ospTutorialFindospray).

To build the tutorial on Linux, build it in a build directory with

    gcc -std=c99 ../apps/ospTutorial/ospTutorial.c \
    -I ../ospray/include -L . -lospray -Wl,-rpath,. -o ospTutorial

On Windows build it can be build manually in a
“build_directory\\\$Configuration” directory with

    cl ..\..\apps\ospTutorial\ospTutorial.c -I ..\..\ospray\include -I ..\.. ospray.lib

Running `ospTutorial` will create two images of two triangles, rendered
with the Scientific Visualization renderer with full Ambient Occlusion.
The first image `firstFrame.ppm` shows the result after one call to
`ospRenderFrame` – jagged edges and noise in the shadow can be seen.
Calling `ospRenderFrame` multiple times enables progressive refinement,
resulting in antialiased edges and converged shadows, shown after ten
frames in the second image `accumulatedFrames.ppm`.

ospExamples
-----------

Apart from tutorials, `OSPRay` comes with a C++ app called
[`ospExamples`](https://github.com/ospray/ospray/tree/master/apps/ospExamples)
which is an elaborate easy-to-use tutorial, with a single interface to
try various `OSPRay` features. It is aimed at providing users with
multiple simple scenes composed of basic geometry types, lights, volumes
etc. to get started with OSPRay quickly.

`ospExamples` app runs a `GLFWOSPRayWindow` instance that manages
instances of the camera, framebuffer, renderer and other OSPRay objects
necessary to render an interactive scene. The scene is rendered on a
`GLFW` window with an `imgui` GUI controls panel for the user to
manipulate the scene at runtime.

The application is located in
[`apps/ospExamples/`](https://github.com/ospray/ospray/tree/master/apps/ospExamples)
directory and can be built with CMake. It can be run from the build
directory via:

    ./ospExamples <command-line-parameter>

The command line parameter is optional however.

</figure>



### Scenes

Different scenes can be selected from the `scenes` dropdown and each
scene corresponds to an instance of a special `detail::Builder` struct.
Example builders are located in
[`apps/common/ospray_testing/builders/`](https://github.com/ospray/ospray/tree/master/apps/common/ospray_testing/builders).
These builders provide a usage guide for the OSPRay scene hierarchy and
OSPRay API in the form of `cpp` wrappers. They instantiate and manage
objects for the specific scene like `cpp::Geometry`, `cpp::Volume`,
`cpp::Light` etc.

The `detail::Builder` base struct is mostly responsible for setting up
OSPRay `world` and objects common in all scenes (for example lighting
and ground plane), which can be conveniently overridden in the derived
builders.

Given below are different scenes listed with their string identifiers:

boxes
:   A simple scene with `box` geometry type.

cornell_box
:   A scene depicting a classic cornell box with `quad` mesh geometry
    type for rendering two cubes and a `quad` light type.

curves
:   A simple scene with `curve` geometry type and options to change
    `curveBasis`. For details on different basis’ please check
    documentation of [curves](#curves).

gravity_spheres_volume
:   A scene with `structuredRegular` type of [volume](#volumes).

gravity_spheres_isosurface
:   A scene depicting iso-surface rendering of `gravity_spheres_volume`
    using geometry type `isosurface`.

perlin_noise_volumes
:   An example scene with `structuredRegular` volume type depicting
    perlin noise.

random_spheres
:   A simple scene depicting `sphere` geometry type.

streamlines
:   A scene showcasing streamlines geometry derived from `curve`
    geometry type.

subdivision_cube
:   A scene with a cube of `subdivision` geometry type to showcase
    subdivision surfaces.

unstructured_volume
:   A simple scene with a volume of `unstructured` volume type.

### Renderer

This app comes with four [renderer](#renderers) options: `scivis`,
`pathtracer`, `ao` and `debug`. The app provides some common rendering
controls like `pixelSamples` and other more specific to the renderer
type like `aoSamples` for the `scivis` and `ao` renderer or
`maxPathLength` for the `pathtracer`.

The sun-sky lighting can be used in a sample scene by enabling the
`renderSunSky` option of the `pathtracer` renderer. It allows the user
to change `turbidity` and `sunDirection`.
