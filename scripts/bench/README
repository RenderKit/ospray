Running Benchmarks
------------------

1. Build OSPRay

Compile OSPRay in a build directory of your choosing. We will refer
to this directory as ${OSPRAY_BUILD_DIR}.

2. Fetch bechmark data using provided script

In ${OSPRAY_BUILD_DIR}, run the "get_benchmark_data.sh" script. Thus
from a "build" directory inside your cloned OSPRay source, you would
run:

% ../scripts/bench/get_benchmark_data.sh

3. Run benchmark script

In ${OSPRAY_BUILD_DIR}, run the "run_benchmark.py" script. Using the
same directory structure from step 2, you would run:

% ../scripts/bench/run_benchmark.py

The benchmarks will use a 1024x1024 frame buffer by default, which can
be modified by passing the width and height to the script. For example,
to run the benchmarks at 1024x768, you would run:

% ../scripts/bench/run_benchmark.py --width 1024 --height 768

The images rendered for each benchmark are saved into a directory (which
is created if it doesn't exist) "test_images", where each image is saved
as a .ppm file.
