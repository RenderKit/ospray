Running Tests
-------------

1. Build OSPRay

Compile OSPRay in a build directory of your choosing. We will refer
to this directory as ${OSPRAY_BUILD_DIR}.

2. Generate baseline images (OPTIONAL)

images should download automatically when OSPRAY_TESTING is on.  Only
generate new images for a test that has changed.  To generate new images for a specific
test run ./regression_tests/ospTestSuite --gtest_filter="*TESTNAME*" --dump-img
which will create images in a folder called baseline.

In ${OSPRAY_BUILD_DIR}, run the "generate_baseline.sh" script:

% ../scripts/tests/generate_baseline.sh

3. Run regression tests

To verify whether a change to the codebase broke anything, run

% ../scripts/tests/run_tests.sh

This will run all tests and compare their results with baseline
images generated in step 2.

4.  To run an individual test
./regression_tests/ospTestSuite --gtest_list_tests
this will output a list of test names
./regression_tests/ospTestSuite --gest_filter="*NAME*"
will run a single test

To add or update generated test images to ospray, use the included update_test_baseline.sh script and then send
the resulting files to ospray developers
or do the following steps:

call md5sum on the resulting .png files.  Add a .png.md5 file to
tests/baseling/TESTNAME.png.md5 with the value of the checksum.  rename
the .png file to be the checksum value, and then send this to OSPRay Devs who
will upload it to sdvis.org under /var/www/html/ospray/download/baseline/benchmark-data/MD5.
