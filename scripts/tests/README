Running Tests
-------------

1. Build OSPRay

Compile OSPRay in a build directory of your choosing. We will refer
to this directory as ${OSPRAY_BUILD_DIR}.

2. Generate baseline images

In ${OSPRAY_BUILD_DIR}, run the "generate_baseline.sh" script:

% ../scripts/tests/generate_baseline.sh

3. Run regression tests

To verify whether a change to the codebase broke anything, run

% ../scripts/tests/run_tests.sh

This will run all tests and compare their results with baseline
images generated in step 2.
