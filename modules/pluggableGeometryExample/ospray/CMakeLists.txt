# this subdirectory builds the actual ospray plugin into a library
# "libospray_module_<modulename>.so".
#
# This shared library can depend on libospray, but should _not_ assume
# that it is living in the same address space as the application: When
# running in MPI mode ospray will, upon encountering the
# ospLoadModule("<moduleName>"), actually load and use this library on
# every worker node (which will typically not run the application). As
# such, the library should _not_ "commuincate" with the application
# through global variables or globally defined functions, and instead
# communicate solely through the ospNewGeometry(...), ospSet...(),
# ospCommit(...) etc functionality provided by ospray.


# build the actual shared library that defines the geometry.
#
# Note the name is important: In order for ospray to properly find and
# initialize a module referenced by a call to
# "ospLoadModule(<moduleName>) this module _has_ to
#
# a) be called libospray_module_<modulename>.so, and
# b) contain a (extern C linkage) initialization routine named
#    OSPError ospray_module_init_<moduleName>(int16_t versionMajor,
#        int16_t versionMinor, int16_t versionPatch)
