# - Try to find readline include dirs and libraries
#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#     find_package(Readline)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  Readline_ROOT_DIR         Set this variable to the root installation of
#                            readline if the module has problems finding the
#                            proper installation path.
#
# Variables defined by this module:
#
#  READLINE_FOUND            System has readline, include and lib dirs found
#  Readline_INCLUDE_DIR      The readline include directories.
#  Readline_LIBRARY          The readline library.
